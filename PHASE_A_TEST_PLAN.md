---

## üêõ Known Issues to Ignore (For Now)

These are **expected** and will be fixed in chatbot deep dive:

### Expected Console Warnings
- `[ChatMVP] Description is too short` - Quality issue, not a bug
- `[ChatMVP] Description appears to use template fallback` - AI quality issue
- Some Firestore permission warnings for other collections - Not critical

### Expected Behavior
- Showcase data may still have quality issues (generic content)
- This is a PROMPT ENGINEERING problem, not a technical bug
- We'll fix in chatbot deep dive tomorrow

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

Phase A+ deployment is successful if:

- [ ] Dashboard loads without permission errors
- [ ] New projects save to Firestore
- [ ] Showcase JSON saves to Storage
- [ ] No date serialization errors
- [ ] No JSON parsing crashes
- [ ] No `:id` routing errors
- [ ] ReviewScreen loads with data

**Minimum**: 6/7 passing = Success ‚úÖ

## üö® If Tests Fail

### Console shows date errors?
```
Check: UnifiedStorageManager.ts lines 760-765
Symptom: "toISOString is not a function"
Fix: Date restoration not working - recheck deployment
```

### Console shows JSON parse errors?
```
Check: ai.ts sanitizeAI function
Symptom: "Unexpected end of JSON input"
Fix: Code fence extraction not working - verify build
```

### Dashboard shows permission errors?
```
Check: Firestore rules deployed?
Run: npx firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
Verify: users/{userId}/projectDrafts rules exist
```

### No data in Firestore/Storage?
```
Check: Browser console for actual errors
Verify: Firebase auth working (check auth.currentUser)
Check: Network tab for failed requests
```
