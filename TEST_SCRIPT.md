## ‚úÖ EXPECTED OUTCOMES

After completing all steps, you should have:
1. A complete blueprint in Firebase
2. Coherent flow from wizard ‚Üí ideation ‚Üí journey ‚Üí deliverables
3. All data preserved between stages
4. No reverting or looping issues
5. Appropriate AI suggestions at each step

## üîÑ Quick Test Commands

**Test Suggestion Buttons:**
- Click "Ideas" ‚Üí Should show contextual idea cards
- Click "What If" ‚Üí Should show exploration cards
- Click "Help" ‚Üí Should show clarification cards

**Test Navigation:**
- Each stage should show 3 steps
- Progress bar should increment properly
- Continue button should appear when step is complete

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Watch For Issues

1. **Data Loss:** Check if wizard info appears in ideation prompts
2. **Loop/Revert:** Deliverables should not go back to step 1
3. **Suggestions:** Should not auto-appear, only on button click
4. **Whitespace:** Check spacing between messages and cards
5. **Progress:** Bar should show 1/3, 2/3, 3/3 for each stage
