# Phase 1: Infrastructure - Completion Report

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Duration:** ~1 hour
**All Tests:** ✅ PASSING (20/20 unit tests)
**Build:** ✅ SUCCESS
**Runtime:** ✅ DEV SERVER WORKING

---

## What Was Accomplished

Phase 1 laid the **foundational infrastructure** for the stage-separated builder without changing any user-facing behavior.

### 1. Data Model Extensions ✅

**File:** `src/services/UnifiedStorageManager.ts`

Added new optional fields to `UnifiedProjectData` interface:
```typescript
// Stage tracking (for segmented builder flow)
currentStage?: 'ideation' | 'journey' | 'deliverables' | 'review';
stageStatus?: {
  ideation: 'not_started' | 'in_progress' | 'complete';
  journey: 'not_started' | 'in_progress' | 'complete';
  deliverables: 'not_started' | 'in_progress' | 'complete';
};
```

**Key Decision:** Fields are optional, allowing lazy computation from existing data. No migration required.

**Testing:** ✅ TypeScript compilation passed with no errors related to new fields.

---

### 2. Stage Status Derivation Utility ✅

**File:** `src/utils/stageStatus.ts` (NEW - 140 lines)

Created a comprehensive utility module with:

**Core Function:** `deriveStageStatus(blueprint)`
- Returns `{ currentStage, stageStatus }` for any project
- Uses stored values if present, otherwise computes from data
- Wraps existing `computeStageProgress()` logic

**Helper Functions:**
- `isStageComplete(blueprint, stage)` - Check if a stage is done
- `getNextStage(currentStage)` - Get next stage in sequence
- `getStageRoute(projectId, stage)` - Generate route paths

**Testing:** ✅ 20/20 unit tests passing
- Tests cover all stage transitions
- Tests verify lazy computation from data
- Tests validate route generation
- Edge cases tested (empty projects, completed projects)

**Test Results:**
```
PASS src/utils/__tests__/stageStatus.test.ts
  deriveStageStatus: 8 tests
  isStageComplete: 4 tests
  getNextStage: 4 tests
  getStageRoute: 4 tests

Tests: 20 passed, 20 total
Time: 0.827s
```

### 3. Stage Routes ✅

**File:** `src/AuthenticatedApp.tsx`

Added three new routes:
- `/app/projects/:id/ideation` → IdeationStage component
- `/app/projects/:id/journey` → JourneyStage component
- `/app/projects/:id/deliverables` → DeliverablesStage component

**Existing route preserved:**
- `/app/project/:id/preview` → ReviewScreen (already exists)

**Implementation Details:**
- Routes use lazy loading for code splitting
- All routes wrapped in `<ProtectedRoute>` and `<AppLayout>`
- Proper Suspense fallbacks for loading states
- Consistent with existing routing patterns

**Testing:** ✅ Build succeeded with routes in bundle:
- `IdeationStage-*.js` (1.57 kB)
- `JourneyStage-*.js` (1.67 kB)
- `DeliverablesStage-*.js` (1.74 kB)

---

### 4. Placeholder Stage Components ✅

**Files Created:**
- `src/features/builder/IdeationStage.tsx` (NEW)
- `src/features/builder/JourneyStage.tsx` (NEW)
- `src/features/builder/DeliverablesStage.tsx` (NEW)

**Purpose:**
Placeholder components that:
- Demonstrate routing works correctly
- Navigate between stages
- Document what needs to be extracted from ChatMVP in future phases
- Provide visual feedback that Phase 1 is complete

**Features:**
- Blue banner indicating "Phase X Placeholder"
- List of components to extract from ChatMVP
- Navigation buttons to test stage transitions
- Project ID display for verification

---

## Testing Strategy Used

### 1. Incremental Testing ✅
After each change, ran specific tests:
- Task 1 → TypeScript compilation check
- Task 2 → Unit test suite (20 tests)
- Task 3 → Build verification
- Task 4 → Dev server smoke test

### 2. Comprehensive Unit Tests ✅
Created test file: `src/utils/__tests__/stageStatus.test.ts`

Test coverage:
- Empty projects default to ideation
- Stored stage data is used when present
- Stage progression follows business logic
- Deliverables requires ≥3 milestones (matches existing logic)
- Review stage tied to `completedAt` field
- Route generation accurate for all stages

### 3. Build Validation ✅
Full production build completed successfully:
- No TypeScript errors related to changes
- All new components bundled correctly
- Build time: 6.44s (normal)
- No new warnings introduced

### 4. Runtime Verification ✅
Dev server started and stopped cleanly:
- Server responded on http://localhost:5173
- No startup errors
- Clean shutdown

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Lazy Stage Status Computation ✅
**Decision:** Compute `currentStage` and `stageStatus` on-demand from existing data, store on next save.

**Rationale:**
- No risky data migration required
- Works with all existing projects immediately
- Gradually backfills as users interact with projects

### 2. Optional Fields ✅
**Decision:** Make new fields optional in TypeScript interface.

**Rationale:**
- Backward compatible with existing data
- Allows graceful degradation
- No breaking changes to existing code

### 3. Reuse Existing Logic ✅
**Decision:** Wrap `computeStageProgress()` instead of rewriting.

**Rationale:**
- Tested logic already exists
- Consistent with current behavior
- Reduces risk of introducing bugs

### 4. Placeholder Components ✅
**Decision:** Create minimal placeholder components instead of waiting for full extraction.

**Rationale:**
- Allows testing of routing immediately
- Validates infrastructure works end-to-end
- Clear visual indicator of what's next
- Doesn't block subsequent phases

## Testing at Each Step

### Step 1: Type Changes
**Test:** `npx tsc --noEmit | grep "currentStage\|stageStatus"`
**Result:** ✅ No errors (pre-existing errors in other files unrelated)

### Step 2: Create Utility
**Test:** `npm test -- src/utils/__tests__/stageStatus.test.ts`
**Result:** ✅ 20/20 tests passed (1 test fixed for 3-milestone requirement)

### Step 3: Add Routes
**Test:** `npm run build`
**Result:** ✅ Build succeeded in 6.44s, components in bundle

### Step 4: Runtime Check
**Test:** Start dev server and verify it runs
**Result:** ✅ Server started on :5173, clean shutdown

---

## No User-Facing Changes

**Critical:** Phase 1 introduces **zero** user-facing changes:
- All new routes are not yet linked from dashboard
- Existing routes work exactly as before
- `/app/blueprint/:id` still routes to ChatMVP (unchanged)
- New fields are optional and computed lazily
- No data migration required

**The app works exactly as it did before Phase 1.**

---

## What's Next: Phase 2

**Goal:** Create the `useStageController` hook for shared orchestration.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement autosave debouncing
- [ ] Stage gating via existing validation
- [ ] Stage transitions (update status + persist)
- [ ] Telemetry event tracking
- [ ] Unit tests for controller logic

**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours

---

## Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers: NONE ✅

### Risks Identified:
1. **Pre-existing TypeScript errors** in test files (not introduced by us)
   - **Mitigation:** Focus testing on our specific changes
   - **Impact:** Low (doesn't affect production build)

2. **Large bundle size warning** (pre-existing)
   - **Mitigation:** Not related to our changes, pre-existing issue
   - **Impact:** Low (performance acceptable)
