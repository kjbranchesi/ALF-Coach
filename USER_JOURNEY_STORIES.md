## Maria - The Veteran Science Teacher
*20 years experience, Urban high school, AP Biology*

### The Context
It's Sunday evening, 8:47 PM. Maria sits at her kitchen table with her laptop, a cup of chamomile tea, and her planning notebook. She's been teaching AP Biology for 15 years but wants to try something different for the ecology unit. Her principal has been pushing for more project-based learning, and she's finally ready to dive in.

### The Journey Begins

Maria opens ALF Coach. The landing page greets her with "Transform Learning Through Real-World Projects." She's skepticalâ€”she's seen plenty of EdTech promisesâ€”but clicks **"Get Started"**.

#### Blueprint Creation - The Wizard (8:48 PM)

The onboarding wizard appears. Maria appreciates that it doesn't ask for her life story.

**"What's your teaching vision?"**
She hovers over the options. "Tech-forward" feels forced. "Traditional" feels limiting. She clicks **"Balanced Approach"**â€”technology where it helps, hands-on where it matters.

**"What subject?"**
She types "AP Biology - Ecology Unit" in the field.

**"Age group?"**
She selects "Ages 15-18"

**"Project duration?"**
She pauses. The AP exam is in 8 weeks. She has 3 weeks for ecology. She selects **"3-4 weeks"**.

**"Group size?"**
"20-30 students" - her typical class size.

**"Where will learning happen?"**
She selects **"Mixed"** - classroom, lab, and field work.

**"Materials available?"**
She types: "Full science lab, microscopes, water testing kits, school garden, proximity to city park with pond"

The wizard completes. She sees a summary and clicks **"Continue to Ideation"**.

#### Ideation Stage (8:52 PM)

ALF Coach asks: **"What's the big idea that will drive your project?"**

Maria starts typing: "Humans impact ecosystems in complex ways"

She pauses, deletes it. Too negative. She tries again: "Ecosystems are delicate balance of..."

She clicks **"Ideas"** for inspiration.

Four suggestion cards appear:
1. "Biodiversity is nature's insurance policy"
2. "Every organism plays a vital role in ecosystem health"
3. "Human actions ripple through ecological networks"
4. "Ecosystems provide services we depend on daily"

She likes #3 but wants to modify it. She types: **"Human actions create ripple effects throughout ecological networks, and we have the power to make those ripples positive"**

She clicks **Continue**.

**"What essential question will students explore?"**

She's ready for this oneâ€”she's been thinking about it all week. She types: **"How can our school become a model for urban biodiversity conservation?"**

No suggestions needed. She clicks **Continue**.

**"What's the real-world challenge?"**

She clicks **"Ideas"** immediatelyâ€”this is where she always gets stuck.

The suggestions appear:
1. "Create a biodiversity action plan for the school campus"
2. "Design a citizen science program for the local park"
3. "Develop a restoration proposal for a degraded local habitat"
4. "Build a biodiversity monitoring system using technology"

She loves #1 but wants to expand it. She selects it, then modifies in the chat: **"Create and implement a biodiversity action plan for our school campus that could be replicated by other urban schools"**

**"What If?"** button pulses. Curious, she clicks it.

"What if students presented to the school board?"
"What if we partnered with the city's environmental department?"
"What if students created a toolkit for other schools?"

Her eyes light up. She types: **"Yes! Add presenting to school board and creating a replication toolkit"**

The system confirms and she moves to the Journey stage.

#### Learning Journey (9:01 PM)

**"Let's design your learning phases"**

Four phase suggestions appear. She's impressedâ€”they align with her thinking but add structure she hadn't considered.

She selects:
- Phase 1: "Biodiversity Baseline Assessment" 
- Phase 2: "Research & Root Cause Analysis"
- Phase 3: "Solution Design & Prototyping"
- Phase 4: "Implementation & Advocacy"

She notices she can reorder them by dragging. Perfect.

**"What activities will students do?"**

She clicks **"Ideas"** and an activity builder appears. She can add and remove activities. She starts clicking:

âœ“ "Conduct biodiversity survey using iNaturalist"
âœ“ "Create species identification guides"
âœ“ "Interview grounds maintenance staff"
âœ— "Build a greenhouse" (too ambitious, she removes this)
âœ“ "Design native plant gardens"
âœ“ "Create QR code tour of ecological improvements"
âœ“ "Prepare school board presentation"

She adds her own: **"Water quality testing of runoff areas"**

Total: 7 activities. She clicks **Continue**.

**"What resources do you need?"**

She's tired now. She clicks the first suggestion: **"iNaturalist app licenses"**

The system says she needs at least one resource but can add more later. She appreciates the flexibility and clicks **Continue**.

#### Deliverables Stage (9:08 PM)

**"What are the key milestones?"**

Three suggestions appear. She selects all three:
- "Baseline biodiversity report"
- "Action plan document"
- "School board presentation"

**"How will you assess student work?"**

A rubric builder appears. She sees suggested criteria:
- Scientific accuracy
- Data collection quality
- Solution feasibility
- Presentation skills

She adds: **"Collaboration effectiveness"**

Each criterion has levels she can customize. She'll fine-tune these tomorrow.

**"Who is the authentic audience?"**

She types: **"School board, facilities department, and environmental science students at our feeder middle school"**

**"How will students share their work?"**

She types: **"Formal presentation to school board, interactive campus tour for middle schoolers, and published toolkit on school website"**

#### The Completion (9:12 PM)

The screen transforms: **"Your Project Blueprint is Ready!"**

She sees a beautiful summary of everything she's created. Two download buttons appear:
- Teacher Implementation Guide (PDF)
- Student Project Guide (PDF)

She downloads both, emails them to herself, and closes her laptop with a smile.

Tomorrow, she'll share this with her AP Bio class. For the first time in years, she's genuinely excited about a new unit.

## James - The First-Year English Teacher
*Fresh from grad school, Suburban middle school, 7th grade*

### The Context
It's Thursday after school, 4:15 PM. James sits in his empty classroom, overwhelmed. His mentor teacher suggested he try project-based learning for the poetry unit. He has no idea where to start. His professor mentioned ALF Coach, so he pulls it up on his laptop.

### The Journey Begins

James stares at the landing page. His hands are actually shaking a littleâ€”imposter syndrome is real. He clicks **"Get Started"**.

#### Blueprint Creation - The Wizard (4:16 PM)

**"What's your teaching vision?"**

James immediately clicks **"I need guidance"**. A tooltip appears: "We'll provide extra support and suggestions throughout your journey." Perfect.

**"What subject?"**
He types: "7th grade English - Poetry"

**"Age group?"**
"Ages 11-14"

**"Project duration?"**
He's unsure. He clicks the **"?"** help icon. It suggests 2-3 weeks for first projects. He selects **"2-3 weeks"**.

**"Group size?"**
"20-30 students" (He has 28, his largest class)

**"Where?"**
**"Classroom-based"** - he doesn't have permission for field trips yet.

**"Materials?"**
He types: "Chromebooks (1:1), printer, basic art supplies"

#### Ideation Stage (4:19 PM)

**"What's the big idea?"**

James freezes. He has no idea. He immediately clicks **"Help"**.

The AI responds: "Think about why poetry matters to your students. What truth about poetry do you want them to discover?"

Still stuck, he clicks **"Ideas"**.

1. "Poetry gives voice to emotions we can't otherwise express"
2. "Poetry lives everywhere in our daily lives"
3. "Everyone is a poet when they pay attention"
4. "Poetry is rebellion disguised as art"

Number 2 resonates. He selects it without modification.

**"Essential Question?"**

He clicks **"Ideas"** immediately.

1. "Where is the poetry hidden in our community?"
2. "How does poetry help us understand ourselves?"
3. "Why do poets choose words so carefully?"
4. "What stories is our community not telling?"

He loves the first one! He selects it, then adds: **"Where is the poetry hidden in our community and how can we amplify it?"**

**"Challenge?"**

He's getting the hang of this. Click **"Ideas"** first, then modify.

1. "Create a poetry anthology of community voices"
2. "Design a poetry walk for the school"
3. "Produce a poetry podcast series"
4. "Host a community poetry slam"

The poetry walk sounds manageable. He selects it but modifies: **"Design and install a temporary poetry walk in our school hallways featuring original student work and community voices"**

#### Learning Journey (4:24 PM)

**"Learning phases?"**

He's grateful for the suggestions. He selects three:
- "Discover: Find poetry in unexpected places"
- "Create: Craft original pieces"
- "Share: Bring poetry to the community"

Simple, clear, doable.

**"Activities?"**

The activity builder is intuitive. He starts adding:
âœ“ "Poetry scavenger hunt in the community"
âœ“ "Interview family members about meaningful poems"
âœ“ "Found poetry from local newspapers"
âœ“ "Write where-I'm-from poems"
âœ“ "Design visual displays for poems"
âœ“ "Install and document poetry walk"

He almost clicks "Create audio recordings" but remembers some students hate their recorded voices. He skips it.

**"Resources?"**

He's tired but clicks through:
âœ“ "Poetry anthology examples"
âœ“ "Display materials and stands"
âœ“ "QR code generator for audio"

Wait, he just said no audio. He removes the QR codes and continues.

#### Deliverables (4:28 PM)

**"Milestones?"**

He selects:
- "Poetry collection (5 original pieces)"
- "Visual display design"
- "Poetry walk installation"

**"Assessment?"**

The rubric builder is overwhelming. He clicks **"Use Suggested Rubric"** and promises himself he'll customize it this weekend.

**"Audience?"**

He types: **"School community, parents during open house, local library"**

**"How will they share?"**

**"Poetry walk in hallways for two weeks, digital anthology on school website, donate physical copies to library"**

#### The Relief (4:31 PM)

The blueprint is complete. James downloads both PDFs and immediately texts his mentor: "I created my first PBL unit! Using something called ALF Coach. Can I show you tomorrow?"

His mentor responds: "That's fantastic! I use ALF too. Bring your blueprint to our meeting."

James feels like maybe, just maybe, he can do this.

## Robert - The Traditional History Teacher
*32 years experience, Rural high school, World History*

### The Context
It's Tuesday during his planning period, 10:15 AM. Robert was "voluntold" to incorporate PBL. He's resistant but professional. His principal specifically mentioned ALF Coach in the mandate email.

### The Journey

Robert opens ALF Coach on his desktop computer (he refuses to use his personal devices for work). He sighs and clicks **"Get Started"**.

#### The Wizard (10:16 AM)

**"Teaching vision?"**
He clicks **"Traditional"** then notices it says "with modern enhancements." Fine.

He fills in:

The system accepts it. He's surprised.

**Essential Question:** He thinks, then types: **"What lessons from WWII still apply today?"**

**Challenge:** He doesn't click "Ideas"â€”he knows what he wants: **"Create a museum exhibit on WWII lessons for modern times"**

But then he clicks **"Help"** out of curiosity.

The AI suggests: "Consider having students focus on local WWII historyâ€”were there veterans from your town? War efforts? This makes it personal."

Robert pauses. His uncle was in the 101st Airborne. His fingers hover over the keyboard.

He modifies: **"Create a museum exhibit connecting our town's WWII stories to modern global challenges"**

#### Journey (10:22 AM)

The phase suggestions surprise himâ€”they're actually pedagogically sound:

He selects:
- "Local History Investigation"
- "Global Context Analysis"

- "Exhibit design templates"

#### Deliverables (10:26 AM)

Milestonesâ€”he keeps it simple:
- "Research portfolio with primary sources"
- "5-panel exhibit with descriptions"
- "Historical argument essay"

He actually reads the suggested rubric. It's... good. Really good. It includes historical thinking skills he's been teaching for years. He keeps it mostly unchanged.

Audience: **"School community, local historical society, town library"**

Sharing: **"Physical exhibit in library for one month, virtual tour on school website"**

#### The Surprise (10:29 AM)

Robert downloads the PDFs and opens the Teacher Guide. It's not fluffy EdTech nonsense. It's a serious, scholarly approach to historical inquiry through projects.

He prints both guides and walks to his principal's office.

"I've created the PBL unit you requested. We're starting Monday."

His principal's jaw drops.

That afternoon, Robert emails his nephew who works at the historical society: "Want to help with a student project?"
