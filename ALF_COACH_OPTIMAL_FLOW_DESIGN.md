# ALF Coach Optimal Flow Design
## Expert PBL Flow Architecture for Maximum Educator Success

---

## Executive Summary

This document presents a comprehensive redesign of the ALF Coach chatbot flow, addressing current usability issues while maintaining PBL integrity. The design balances pedagogical best practices with practical classroom constraints, providing differentiated pathways for educators at varying experience levels.

### Key Design Principles
1. **Progressive Disclosure** - Information revealed as needed, not all at once
2. **Contextual Scaffolding** - Support adapts to educator experience level
3. **Clear Progression** - Visual and functional indicators of journey progress
4. **Cognitive Load Management** - Chunked, digestible interactions
5. **Recovery & Flexibility** - Easy correction and iteration paths

## Part 1: Persona-Based Journey Mapping

### Persona A: New to PBL Teacher
**Profile:** First-time PBL implementer, possibly mandated by school, anxious about structure

#### Journey Architecture
```
ENTRY → ORIENTATION → GUIDED CREATION → SUPPORTED IMPLEMENTATION
```

##### Stage 1: Ideation (Big Idea → Essential Question → Challenge)
**Cognitive Load:** LOW - One concept at a time

**Big Idea Step:**
- **AI Prompt:** "Let's start simple. What topic from your curriculum are you most excited to teach this term? Just share the topic - we'll build from there."
- **Suggestion Cards:**
  - "Browse example Big Ideas from [Grade Level]"
  - "See how others transformed curriculum topics"
  - "What makes a good Big Idea?"
- **Help Content:** 2-minute video: "Big Ideas in 90 Seconds"
- **Stuck Handler:** If no response in 30s: "Would you like to see some examples from other [Subject] teachers?"

**Essential Question Step:**
- **AI Prompt:** "Great choice! Now let's turn '[their Big Idea]' into a question students will explore. Complete this: 'How might we...' or 'Why does...'"
- **Suggestion Cards:**
  - "Transform my idea into a question"
  - "See question stems for [Subject]"
  - "Check if my question is 'essential'"
- **Help Content:** Interactive checklist: "Is your question essential?"
- **Stuck Handler:** Offer 3 pre-built questions based on their Big Idea

**Challenge Step:**
- **AI Prompt:** "Perfect! Now, what could students CREATE or DO to answer this question? Think about something they could share with others."

**Progress Indicators:**
- Milestone badges after each step
- Encouraging messages: "You've built your foundation!"
- Save points with ability to return

##### Stage 2: Journey (Phases → Activities → Resources)
**Cognitive Load:** MEDIUM - Pre-structured templates offered

**AI Behavior:**
- Provides templates: "Here's a proven 4-phase structure for your grade level"
- Fills in suggestions based on their ideation
- Asks for confirmation rather than creation

**Suggestion Cards:**
- "Use our recommended journey for [Grade/Subject]"
- "Adapt a successful project template"

   - Shows stage-specific suggestions
   - Maximum 4 cards at once
   - Refreshes with "Show more" option

2. **What-If Button**
   - Exploratory scenarios
   - "What if we had more time?"
   - "What if students worked remotely?"

3. **Help Button**
   - Context-aware content
   - "About this step" (current focus)
   - "See examples" (relevant samples)
   - "Talk to coach" (detailed guidance)

## Appendix B: Example Interaction Flows

### New Teacher - Big Idea Step

**AI:** "Let's start simple. What topic from your curriculum are you most excited to teach this term?"

**Teacher:** "I need to teach about ecosystems"

**AI:** "Great choice! Ecosystems is perfect for PBL. Let's make it personally meaningful for students. How about: 'The interconnected web of life in our local environment' - this lets students explore ecosystems through their own community. Does this resonate, or would you like to adjust it?"

**Suggestion Cards appear:**
- "Add human impact angle"
- "Focus on specific habitat"
- "Connect to climate change"
- "Include food systems"

**Teacher clicks:** "Add human impact angle"

**AI:** "Perfect addition! So your Big Idea becomes: 'How human actions affect the interconnected web of life in our local environment.' This gives students a lens to examine their own impact. Shall we move forward with this?"

**Teacher:** "Yes"

**AI:** "Wonderful! You've created a Big Idea that will really engage students. ✓ Step complete! Now let's turn this into a driving question..."

### Experienced Teacher - Multi-Input Flow

**Teacher:** "I want to do a project on sustainable cities. My essential question is 'How might we redesign our downtown to be carbon neutral by 2040?' Challenge is to present to city council."

**AI:** "Excellent! You've moved quickly through ideation:
• Big Idea: Sustainable urban design
• EQ: How might we redesign downtown for carbon neutrality by 2040?
• Challenge: Present solutions to city council

This is ambitious and authentic! A few enhancement options:

1. **Student Choice:** Offer zones for different teams?
2. **Scaffolding:** Need interim presentations to planning commission?
3. **Resources:** Should I connect you with city planning contacts?

What aspects would you like to develop?"

### AI Prompt Engineering Patterns

**For New Teachers:**
```
You are a supportive PBL coach working with a teacher new to project-based learning.
- Provide ONE clear next step
- Offer concrete examples
- Celebrate small wins
- Never overwhelm with options
- If they struggle, provide a template they can modify
```

**For Experienced Teachers:**
```
You are a collaborative PBL thought partner working with an experienced educator.
- Validate their ideas first
- Suggest enhancements, not replacements
- Offer research-backed strategies
- Connect to broader frameworks
- Challenge when appropriate
```

**For Expert Teachers:**
```
You are a PBL innovation consultant working with an expert practitioner.
- Be concise and efficient
- Focus on cutting-edge approaches
- Provide system-level thinking
- Suggest research opportunities
- Connect to the broader PBL community
```

## Conclusion

This flow design addresses all identified issues while maintaining PBL integrity:

1. **Clear button purposes** - Each action is labeled and contextual
2. **Stage-specific suggestions** - Cards change based on current focus
3. **Obvious help system** - Progressive support that doesn't overwhelm
4. **Visible progression** - Multiple indicators of journey progress
5. **Managed cognitive load** - Information chunked appropriately

The differentiated pathways ensure every educator, regardless of experience, can successfully create authentic, engaging PBL experiences for their students.

Most importantly, this design embodies PBL principles in its own structure - starting with the end in mind (successful project creation), providing scaffolded inquiry (progressive disclosure), and culminating in authentic products (classroom-ready PBL plans).
