# Phase 2 Architecture Cleanup

## Summary
This document tracks the old Phase 2 architecture files that can be safely removed now that the new Phase 3/4 architecture is fully integrated.

## Files Removed
1. `/src/features/journey/` - Old journey components (already removed)
   - ConversationalJourney.jsx
   - ConversationalJourneyPro.jsx
   - JourneyProgress.jsx

## Files to Keep (Still in Use)
These files are still being used by the application and should NOT be removed:

### Wizard Components (New Architecture)
- `/src/features/wizard/` - New wizard implementation still in use

### Chat Components 
- `/src/features/chat/ChatV5.tsx` - Main chat component still referenced
- Other chat files may be deprecated but need verification

### Ideation Components
- Some ideation components may still be in use, need verification

### Deliverables Components  
- Some deliverables components may still be in use, need verification

## Recommendation
Before removing any additional files:

1. Run comprehensive tests to ensure no broken imports
2. Check MainWorkspace.jsx for any active imports
3. Verify the new architecture handles all functionality
4. Consider keeping old files archived rather than deleting immediately

## Cleanup Commands (USE WITH CAUTION)
```bash
# Archive old files instead of deleting
mkdir -p archive/phase2
mv src/features/chat/Chat*.tsx archive/phase2/ 2>/dev/null || true
mv src/features/ideation/Conversational*.jsx archive/phase2/ 2>/dev/null || true
mv src/features/deliverables/Conversational*.jsx archive/phase2/ 2>/dev/null || true
```

## Status
- ✅ Journey components removed
- ⚠️ Other components need verification before removal
- 🔄 New architecture is fully functional
