# AI Debug Log - ALF Coach

## Issues Found

### 1. Model Issue
- Changed from `gemini-2.5-flash` to `gemini-2.0-flash` (removed thinking mode)
- Location: `/src/services/ai-conversation-manager.ts`

### 2. Generic Response Issue
The AI is returning empty/invalid responses, causing fallback text "Let me help you with that" to appear.

### 3. Validation Score Issue
- AI responses scoring 25/100 due to missing required elements:
  - Must include "transferable concept"
  - Must include "real-world"
  - Must have "inspiring" tone
  - Should be 150-300 characters

### 4. Root Cause
The SOPValidator is too strict and expecting very specific keywords that the AI isn't providing.

## Debugging Steps

1. Added full response logging in ai-conversation-manager.ts
2. Changed model to non-thinking version
3. Need to either:
   - Fix prompts to generate responses that pass validation
   - Reduce validation strictness
   - Bypass validation temporarily

## Next Steps

1. Test with logging to see actual AI responses
2. Adjust prompts or validation based on what AI returns
3. Test full flow once responses work
