# Fix for Conversational Continue Button Issue

## Problem Analysis
1. When users type conversationally (e.g., "not sure help me"), the AI responds with helpful content
2. However, this content is NOT being passed to `sopFlowManager.updateStepData()`
3. Therefore, `canAdvance()` returns false and the Continue button stays disabled
4. The system only works when users click on the provided cards/buttons

## Root Cause
The conversational interface is not connected to the SOPFlowManager's data update mechanism. The AI generates good content, but it's only displayed - not stored in the blueprint.

## Solution Needed
We need to intercept the AI response and:
1. Parse the conversational content
2. Extract the relevant data for the current step
3. Call `sopFlowManager.updateStepData()` with that data
4. This will enable the Continue button

## Key Files to Modify
1. **Component handling the chat** - needs to call sopFlowManager.updateStepData()
2. **SOPFlowManager** - already fixed to handle various formats
3. **Conversational components** - need to expose the data to parent

## Temporary Workaround
Until we can properly integrate the conversational flow:
1. Click on one of the suggested cards/buttons that appear
2. This will properly update the SOPFlowManager
3. The Continue button will then be enabled

## The Real Issue
The system has two parallel paths:
1. **Card/Button clicks** → Updates SOPFlowManager → Enables Continue ✅
2. **Conversational input** → Shows AI response → Does NOT update SOPFlowManager → Continue stays disabled ❌

We need to make path 2 also update the SOPFlowManager.
