# ALF Coach Migration Roadmap: Legacy to New Architecture

## Executive Summary

This roadmap outlines the strategic migration from the current legacy architecture (`/app/*` routes) to the new advanced architecture (`/new` route) for ALF Coach. The migration will be executed in 5 phases over 8-12 weeks, ensuring zero downtime and maintaining backward compatibility for existing users.

## Current State Analysis

### Legacy Architecture (/app/*)
- **Router**: React Router with `/app/dashboard` and `/app/workspace/:projectId`
- **Data Model**: Firebase `projects` collection with complex nested chat history
- **UI Components**: MainWorkspace.jsx with multiple wizard components
- **State Management**: AppContext with imperative navigation
- **Chat System**: ChatModule.jsx with legacy message handling
- **Progress Tracking**: PROJECT_STAGES enum with manual stage advancement

### New Architecture (/new)
- **Router**: Single `/new` route with URL parameters for state
- **Data Model**: Firebase `blueprints` collection with structured SOPTypes
- **UI Components**: ChatInterface.tsx with modern error boundaries
- **State Management**: SOPFlowManager.ts with reactive state machine
- **Chat System**: ChatContainer.tsx with advanced message handling
- **Progress Tracking**: Step-based progress with automatic advancement

### Key Differences
| Aspect | Legacy | New |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Data Collections | `projects` | `blueprints` |
| Stage Management | Manual enum-based | Automated state machine |
| UI Framework | JSX + CSS classes | TypeScript + Framer Motion |
| Error Handling | Basic try/catch | Error boundaries + recovery |
| State Persistence | Firebase real-time | SOPFlowManager + auto-save |
| Progress Model | Linear stages | Step-based with validation |
