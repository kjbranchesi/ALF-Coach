## Why These Were Archived

1. **Redundancy**: Multiple versions of the same documentation
2. **Completion**: Sprint/phase reports for completed work
3. **Resolution**: Fix documents for resolved issues
4. **Supersession**: Docs replaced by newer versions
5. **Confusion**: Having 90+ docs in root made navigation difficult

## Current Documentation

The following remain in the root as current, active documentation:
- `ALF_COACH_HANDOFF_REPORT.md` - Current project status
- `ALF_COACH_CONVERSATION_FLOW_PROCESS_GUIDE.md` - Active flow guide
- `COMPREHENSIVE_ALF_COACH_EDUCATIONAL_FLOW_REPORT.md` - Educational framework
- `README.md` - Main project documentation
- Technical specs and architecture docs
- Deployment and setup guides

## Impact

- **Before**: 91 .md files in root directory
- **After**: ~15 current .md files in root
- **Archived**: 76 files moved to this archive
- **Result**: 83% reduction in root directory clutter
