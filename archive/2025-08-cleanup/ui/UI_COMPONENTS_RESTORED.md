# ‚úÖ UI Guidance Components Restored

## What We've Implemented

### 1. **UIGuidanceProvider Component**
A comprehensive UI guidance system that provides:
- **Ideas Button** - AI-powered suggestions when users need inspiration
- **Help Button** - Contextual help for every stage
- **Suggestion Cards** - Smart recommendations based on user behavior

### 2. **Clear Framework for Each Component**

#### **Ideas Button** üöÄ
**When it appears:**
- Input field is empty
- User has been idle for 10+ seconds
- User is stuck (detected by hesitation patterns)

**What it provides:**
- Stage-specific ideas (Ideation, Journey, Deliverables)
- Context-aware suggestions based on subject and age group
- 5 curated options per step

**Example Ideas:**
- Big Idea: "Students will understand how climate affects daily life"
- Essential Question: "How does where we live shape who we are?"
- Challenge: "Design a sustainable solution for our school"

#### **Help Button** ‚ÑπÔ∏è
**Always visible** with contextual content:
- Stage-specific guidance
- Tips and best practices
- Real examples relevant to their project
- Educational explanations of ALF concepts

**Content Structure:**
- Title: Current stage name
- Description: What this stage accomplishes
- Tips: Bullet points of key guidance
- Example: Concrete example for their context

#### **Suggestion Cards** üí°
**Intelligent triggering based on:**
- 15+ seconds of inactivity
- Completion of a step
- Detection of potential issues
- Cross-stage opportunities

**Types of suggestions:**
- Project ideas based on subject/age
- Cross-curricular connections
- Implementation strategies
- Next step recommendations

### 3. **Integration with ChatbotFirstInterface**

The components are now integrated with:
- **User context awareness** - Uses onboarding data (subject, age, location)
- **Interaction tracking** - Monitors idle time and engagement
- **Smart positioning** - Non-intrusive placement
- **Smooth animations** - Professional transitions

### 4. **Visual Design**

- **Ideas Button**: Purple/pink gradient with pulse animation when idle
- **Help Button**: Blue with stable presence
- **Suggestion Cards**: Enhanced cards with icons and descriptions
- **Side panels**: Slide-in panels for Ideas and Help content
- **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes

## How It Works

```typescript
<UIGuidanceProvider
  currentStage={projectState.stage}           // IDEATION, JOURNEY, DELIVERABLES
  currentStep={getCurrentStep()}              // bigIdea, essentialQuestion, etc.
  userContext={userContext}                   // Subject, age, location from wizard
  onIdeaSelect={(idea) => setInput(idea)}    // Populates input with selected idea
  onSuggestionSelect={handleSuggestion}      // Handles card selection
  inputValue={input}                         // Current input value
  lastInteractionTime={lastInteractionTime}  // Tracks user activity
  isWaiting={isTyping}                      // Hides during AI response
/>
```
