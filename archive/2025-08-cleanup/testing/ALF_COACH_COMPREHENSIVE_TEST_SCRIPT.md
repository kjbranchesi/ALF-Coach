## STAGE 1: WIZARD ONBOARDING

### Step 1: Goals/Motivation
**Copy-Paste Response:**
```
I want my 7th graders to become environmental stewards by investigating water quality in our local community. They've been hearing about water pollution in the news, and I want them to understand how this affects their own neighborhood. My goal is to combine rigorous science learning with authentic community engagement, where students collect real data, analyze it using scientific methods, and present their findings to local decision-makers. I believe this project will help them see themselves as capable scientists who can make a difference in their community while mastering key concepts about ecosystems, human impact, and data analysis.

## STAGE 2: IDEATION (Steps 1-3)

### Step 1: Big Idea
**Initial Response:**
```
Students will discover how human activities impact local water ecosystems and develop actionable solutions for their community. Through hands-on scientific investigation, they'll understand the interconnected nature of environmental systems while building skills as environmental advocates and community scientists.
```

**If AI asks for refinement or you want to use "Refine" button:**
```
I want to emphasize both the scientific rigor and the community impact. Students should master water chemistry concepts, data collection methods, and scientific communication while also developing a sense of environmental responsibility and civic engagement. The big idea is that middle schoolers can be real scientists solving real problems in their own backyard.
```

**Expected AI Response Pattern:**
The AI should acknowledge the connection between scientific learning and community engagement, possibly asking about specific learning objectives or how this aligns with standards.

### Step 2: Essential Question
**Initial Response:**
```
How does human activity affect the health of water ecosystems in our community, and what can we do to protect and improve them?
```

**If AI suggests refinement:**
```
You're right - let me make it more focused. How can we use scientific data to evaluate the health of our local water sources and convince our community to take action for improvement?
```

**Expected AI Response Pattern:**
The AI should validate this as an open-ended, investigable question that connects to the Big Idea and suggests this could drive authentic inquiry.

### Step 3: Challenge
**Initial Response:**
```
Students will conduct a comprehensive water quality assessment of three local water sources, analyze their findings using scientific methods, and present evidence-based recommendations to the city council or local environmental committee. The final deliverable will be a community presentation with data visualizations, proposed solutions, and a call to action that demonstrates their scientific expertise while advocating for environmental protection.
```

**If AI asks for clarification or suggests modifications:**
```
The challenge should feel authentic - these aren't just school reports that only the teacher sees. Students will present to real decision-makers with actual data they collected. I want them to experience the full scientific process from hypothesis to community impact, understanding that science is a tool for positive change.
```

**Expected AI Response Pattern:**
The AI should recognize the authentic nature of the challenge and possibly suggest ways to scaffold the complexity for 7th graders or connect to real community partnerships.

## STAGE 3: JOURNEY (Steps 4-6)

### Step 4: Phases
**Initial Response:**
```
Phase 1: Foundation & Planning (Week 1-2) - Students learn basic water chemistry concepts, research local water sources, and develop testable hypotheses about water quality factors.

Phase 2: Data Collection (Week 3-4) - Teams visit three different water sites (creek, pond, treated water), conduct systematic testing for pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, turbidity, and pollutants, while documenting observations.

Phase 3: Analysis & Interpretation (Week 5-6) - Students analyze their data, create graphs and charts, compare findings to EPA standards, and research potential causes for any problems discovered.

Phase 4: Solution Development (Week 7) - Teams research evidence-based solutions for any water quality issues they found and develop recommendations appropriate for their community context.

Phase 5: Community Presentation (Week 8) - Students create presentations with data visualizations and present their findings and recommendations to local officials, parents, and community members.
```

**If AI suggests modifications:**
```
I like your suggestions about making the phases more connected. Let me refine this to show clearer progression where each phase builds scientific understanding while moving toward the community impact goal.
```

**Expected AI Response Pattern:**
The AI should validate the logical progression and might suggest ways to ensure scientific rigor or enhance community connections.

### Step 5: Activities
**Initial Response:**
```
Week 1: Water chemistry lab stations where students test different substances to understand pH, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity. Students create "water quality detective" notebooks.

Week 2: Community mapping activity where teams research and map local water sources, identifying potential pollution sources and forming hypotheses about expected water quality.

Week 3: Field investigation day at the creek - teams rotate through testing stations, collect water samples, document environmental observations, and interview any community members they encounter.

Week 4: Lab analysis sessions where students examine water samples under microscopes, complete full testing protocols, and begin data recording in digital formats.

Week 5: Data analysis workshops using spreadsheets to create graphs, calculate averages, and compare findings to environmental standards. Students practice presenting data clearly.

Week 6: Solution research projects where teams investigate successful water quality improvement projects from other communities and evaluate which approaches might work locally.

Week 7: Presentation preparation including creating visual displays, practicing public speaking, and rehearsing Q&A sessions with peer feedback.

Week 8: Community presentation event followed by reflection journals about the scientific process and their role as environmental stewards.
```

**If AI suggests additions or modifications:**
```
I appreciate the suggestion to include more collaborative elements. Students should definitely have opportunities to compare findings between teams and build on each other's discoveries throughout the process.
```

**Expected AI Response Pattern:**
The AI should recognize the balance between hands-on science and communication skills, possibly suggesting ways to differentiate for various learning styles.

### Step 6: Resources
**Initial Response:**
```
Essential Resources:
- Water testing kits with pH strips, dissolved oxygen meters, thermometers, and turbidity tubes
- Digital devices (tablets/phones) for data collection and photo documentation
- Basic microscopes for sample examination
- Spreadsheet software for data analysis and graphing
- Local water quality standards from EPA and state environmental agencies

Community Partnerships:
- County environmental office for expert guidance and data comparison

**If AI asks about budget constraints or alternative resources:**
```
Most of our testing equipment can be borrowed from the high school, and I'm willing to write a small grant for consumable materials. If needed, we can partner with local environmental groups who often have testing equipment available for educational use.
```

**Expected AI Response Pattern:**
The AI should acknowledge the comprehensive resource list and might suggest free or low-cost alternatives, or ways to leverage community partnerships.

```

**If AI asks about logistics or feasibility:**
```
I've already reached out to our city council liaison who is excited about student participation. The environmental committee meets monthly and welcomes public input. This gives students an authentic audience while teaching them about civic engagement and the role of science in policy-making.
```

**Expected AI Response Pattern:**
The AI should recognize the authentic community connections and multi-layered impact approach, possibly suggesting ways to document the long-term effects of student work.
