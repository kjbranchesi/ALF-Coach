# Complete MVP Implementation - DONE ✅

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. ✅ **Three-Button System** (Replacing Confusing Single Button)
**Location**: Chat input area in `ChatbotFirstInterfaceFixed.tsx`

The new button system shows:
- **Primary Action** (Blue) - Context-aware labels:
  - "I have an idea" when input is empty in BIG_IDEA stage
  - "I have a question" in ESSENTIAL_QUESTION stage  
  - "Send" when user has typed something
- **Get Ideas** (White) - Shows stage-specific suggestions
- **Get Help** (White) - Shows stage-specific guidance

### 2. ✅ **Stage-Specific Suggestions**
**Files**: `StageSpecificSuggestions.tsx`, `stageSpecificContent.ts`

Suggestions now change based on:
- Current stage (Big Idea, Essential Question, Challenge, etc.)
- User's subject area (Science, History, Math, etc.)
- Previous responses (builds on Big Idea for Essential Question)
- Grade level context

### 3. ✅ **Contextual Help System**
**Integrated**: Inline help panel above input area

When user clicks "Get Help":
- Shows stage-specific guidance
- Provides tips relevant to current task
- Simple, clear explanations
- Can be dismissed easily

### 4. ✅ **Enhanced AI Prompts**
**Location**: `generateAIPrompt()` function

AI now receives:
- Stage-specific instructions
- Clear current task (e.g., "Help create an Essential Question")
- Full context from wizard data
- Progress tracking (what's been completed)

### 5. ✅ **Simplified Stage Progression**
**Location**: `detectStageTransition()` function

Automatic progression through:
1. GROUNDING → BIG_IDEA (after context)
2. BIG_IDEA → ESSENTIAL_QUESTION (when idea provided)
3. ESSENTIAL_QUESTION → CHALLENGE (when question provided)
4. CHALLENGE → JOURNEY (when challenge defined)
5. JOURNEY → DELIVERABLES (after planning)
6. DELIVERABLES → COMPLETE

## How It Works Now

### User Experience Flow:

1. **Complete Wizard** → Click "Start Project"
2. **Enter Chat** with personalized welcome message
3. **See Three Clear Buttons** instead of one confusing button
4. **Click "Show examples"** → Get stage-specific suggestions
5. **Click "What's a Big Idea?"** → Get contextual help
6. **Type response** → Click "Send" or press Enter
7. **AI responds** with stage-appropriate guidance
8. **Automatic progression** to next stage when ready

## What Each Button Does

### In BIG_IDEA Stage:
- **"I have an idea"** - Ready to share their Big Idea
- **"Show examples"** - Shows 3 contextual Big Idea examples
- **"What's a Big Idea?"** - Explains the concept with tips

### In ESSENTIAL_QUESTION Stage:
- **"I have a question"** - Ready to share their Essential Question
- **"Example questions"** - Shows questions based on their Big Idea
- **"Help me understand"** - Explains Essential Questions

### In CHALLENGE Stage:
- **"I have a challenge"** - Ready to define the challenge
- **"Suggest challenges"** - Shows authentic challenge ideas
- **"What makes a good challenge?"** - Explains challenge criteria
