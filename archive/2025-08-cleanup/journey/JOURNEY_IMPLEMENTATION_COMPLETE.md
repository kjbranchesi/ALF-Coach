# Learning Journey Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented a simplified 3-question Learning Journey flow that addresses all the critical issues identified in the original feedback.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Simplified Question Flow
**Replaced abstract "phases" with concrete questions:**
- Question 1: "How will students move through this project from start to finish?"
- Question 2: "What will students actually DO during each part of the journey?"  
- Question 3: "What support, tools, and materials will students need to succeed?"

### 2. Grade-Level Scaffolding
**Added contextual examples based on grade level:**
- Elementary: Simple language, concrete examples
- Middle School: Age-appropriate complexity
- High School: More sophisticated options
- University: Student-driven choices

### 3. Cohesive Journey Summary
**Created JourneySummary component that shows:**
- Visual timeline of progression
- Connected activities for each stage
- Organized resources by category
- Implementation guidance
- Export capabilities

### 4. UI/UX Improvements
- Fixed z-index issues with phase cards
- Consistent pill-shaped input fields
- Help hints only show when Ideas/Help buttons available
- Progress sidebar shows Journey data correctly
