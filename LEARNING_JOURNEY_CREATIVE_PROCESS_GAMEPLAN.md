# Learning Journey Redesign Game Plan
## Based on the Creative Process Framework

---

## Executive Summary

The Learning Journey will be completely redesigned around the **Creative Process Framework** with exactly **4 fixed phases**: Analyze → Brainstorm → Prototype → Evaluate. Only the timeline adapts based on project duration. This creates consistency while allowing flexibility for iteration and non-linear progression.

---

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Fixed Structure, Flexible Timing
- **Always 4 phases** regardless of project length
- **Proportional time allocation** that scales with total duration
- **Built-in iteration** as a feature, not a bug

### 2. Clean & Sophisticated
- **Visual simplicity** with depth on demand
- **Progressive disclosure** of complexity
- **Intuitive flow** that guides without constraining

### 3. Pedagogically Sound
- **Research-based** Creative Process methodology
- **Authentic** to real creative work
- **Assessment-integrated** not bolted on

## The New Learning Journey Architecture

### Phase Structure (Fixed)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          THE CREATIVE PROCESS               │
│                                             │
│  ┌──────────┐      ┌──────────┐           │
│  │ ANALYZE  │ ←──→ │BRAINSTORM│           │
│  └──────────┘      └──────────┘           │
│       ↑↓               ↑↓                  │
│  ┌──────────┐      ┌──────────┐           │
│  │ EVALUATE │ ←──→ │PROTOTYPE │           │
│  └──────────┘      └──────────┘           │
│                                             │
│  Arrows show iteration possibilities        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Timeline Adaptation

#### Default Time Allocations:
- **Analyze**: 25% of total time
- **Brainstorm**: 25% of total time  
- **Prototype**: 35% of total time
- **Evaluate**: 15% of total time

#### Examples:
- **2 weeks**: Analyze (3 days) → Brainstorm (3 days) → Prototype (5 days) → Evaluate (2 days)
- **4 weeks**: Analyze (1 week) → Brainstorm (1 week) → Prototype (1.5 weeks) → Evaluate (0.5 week)
- **8 weeks**: Analyze (2 weeks) → Brainstorm (2 weeks) → Prototype (3 weeks) → Evaluate (1 week)

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Framework (Immediate)

#### 1.1 Visual Design
```
Journey Builder Interface:

┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Your Learning Journey: [4 weeks total]     │
├────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                            │
│  [Analyze]──[Brainstorm]──[Prototype]──[Evaluate]
│     Week 1    Week 1-2     Week 2-3     Week 4
│                                            │
│  ⟲ Iteration enabled at all phases        │
│                                            │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### 1.2 Phase Builder
For each phase, teachers define:

```typescript
interface Phase {
  name: 'Analyze' | 'Brainstorm' | 'Prototype' | 'Evaluate';
  duration: TimeRange; // Calculated from total project time
  objectives: string[]; // What students will learn
  activities: Activity[]; // What students will do
  deliverables: Deliverable[]; // What students will produce
  iterationSupport: {
    triggers: string[]; // When students might need to loop back
    resources: string[]; // Support for iteration
    timeBuffer: number; // Built-in flex time
  };
  assessment: {
    formative: string[]; // Check-ins during phase
    summative: string; // Phase completion evidence
  };
}
```

#### 1.3 User Flow

**Step 1: Timeline Confirmation**
```
"Your project is [4 weeks] long. Here's how the Creative Process 
phases will be distributed:"

[Visual timeline with adjustable phase boundaries]

[✓ Looks good] [Adjust timing]
```

**Step 2: Phase-by-Phase Planning**
```
ANALYZE PHASE (Week 1)
Understanding the Problem

Learning Objectives:
□ Students will identify root causes
□ Students will research existing solutions
□ Students will define success criteria

Key Activities: (Add 2-4)
[+ Research existing solutions]
[+ Interview stakeholders]
[+ Create problem maps]

[AI Suggestions] [Examples] [Help]

Phase Deliverable:
○ Research report
○ Problem analysis presentation
○ Data visualization
● Student choice

Iteration Planning:
"Some students may need to return here when they discover gaps 
during prototyping. How will you support that?"
[Text area for teacher planning]
```

**Step 3: Iteration & Flexibility**
```
"Where can students have agency in their creative process?"

During ANALYZE phase:
□ Choice of research methods
□ Which aspects to investigate
□ How to document findings

Iteration Options:
□ Students can return to any previous phase
□ Major pivots allowed with approval
□ Complete restarts permitted if needed
```

**Step 4: Assessment Integration**
```
"How will you assess the creative journey, not just the final product?"

Journey Portfolio Components:
□ Process documentation (20%)
□ Iteration reflections (15%)
□ Phase deliverables (40%)
□ Final presentation (25%)

[Generate Rubric] [Use Template]
```

## Conclusion

This redesign transforms the Learning Journey from a confusing, disconnected experience into a clear, pedagogically-sound implementation of the Creative Process. By fixing the structure at 4 phases while allowing temporal flexibility and iteration, we provide both consistency and adaptability.

The key innovation is treating iteration as a designed feature rather than a deviation, making the messy reality of creative work visible, valued, and assessable.

**The Result**: Teachers can confidently guide students through authentic creative processes while maintaining clear structure and assessment criteria.
