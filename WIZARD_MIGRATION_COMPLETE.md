# Wizard Migration Complete! ðŸŽ‰

## What Changed

### Before
When clicking "New Project" in the dashboard:
1. Old WizardWrapper component would appear
2. Complete the old wizard flow
3. Create blueprint with `wizardData` structure
4. Then navigate to new architecture

### After
When clicking "New Project" in the dashboard:
1. Immediately navigates to new architecture
2. SOPFlowManager handles the wizard flow internally
3. Uses the built-in WIZARD stage with steps:
   - WIZARD_VISION
   - WIZARD_SUBJECT
   - WIZARD_STUDENTS
   - WIZARD_LOCATION
   - WIZARD_RESOURCES
   - WIZARD_SCOPE
4. Seamless transition to IDEATION stage

## Technical Changes

### 1. Dashboard.jsx
- Removed WizardWrapper import
- Changed new project behavior to navigate directly to `/app/blueprint/new-{timestamp}`
- No more intermediate wizard component

### 2. NewArchitectureTest.tsx
- Added handling for "new-" prefixed IDs
- Creates fresh SOPFlowManager when ID starts with "new-"
- Updates URL to real blueprint ID after creation

### 3. Removed Dependencies
- No longer using WizardWrapper component
- No longer creating blueprints with old `wizardData` structure

## Benefits

1. **Single Architecture** - Everything uses the new SOPFlowManager flow
2. **Consistent Experience** - Same UI/UX throughout the entire process
3. **No Data Migration** - Blueprints created with correct structure from start
4. **Cleaner Code** - Removed duplicate wizard implementation

## Test the Changes

1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to dashboard: `/app/dashboard`
3. Click "New Project"
4. You should see the new ChatInterface with wizard prompts
5. Complete the wizard flow
6. Automatically transition to Ideation stage

## Next Steps

Now that everything uses the new architecture, we can:
1. Remove old wizard components (WizardWrapper, etc.)
2. Remove all old conversational components
3. Start integrating Phase 3 enrichment services

The migration to the new architecture is now complete!
