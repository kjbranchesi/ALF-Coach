- Include project reference where applicable: `sustainability-data-visualization.png`
- Version control: `hero-banner-v2.jpg`

### Technical Specifications
- **Hero images**: 1920x1080px minimum, high quality JPG/PNG
- **Thumbnails**: 400x300px, optimized for web
- **Icons**: SVG format preferred, PNG fallback at 64x64px minimum
- **File size**: Optimize for web without sacrificing quality
- **Formats**: JPG for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency, SVG for icons

### Content Guidelines
- Use diverse, inclusive imagery
- Focus on authentic learning moments
- Show real student work and engagement
- Avoid stock photo appearance
- Ensure proper licensing and permissions

## Usage in Code

Images can be referenced in React components using:
```jsx
// For hero project images
import heroImage from '/images/hero-projects/sustainability-campaign/hero-banner.jpg';

// For UI assets
<img src="/images/ui-assets/icons/science-icon.svg" alt="Science" />

// For project resources
<img src="/images/project-resources/science/lab-equipment.jpg" alt="Lab setup" />
```

## Placeholder System

Currently, this structure contains empty directories. As images are created:
1. Add actual image files to appropriate directories
2. Update this README with specific file descriptions
3. Reference new images in component code
4. Test loading and optimization

This organized structure ensures scalable image management as the platform grows and more hero projects are developed.
