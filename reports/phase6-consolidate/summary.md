# Phase 6 – Consolidated UX & Seed Path

## Modified Files
- `src/features/chat/ChatLoader.tsx` – added seedId handling to spin unified projects into blueprints before chat loads.
- `src/pages/ProjectShowcase.tsx` – unified loading, action bar, and “Open in Design Studio”.
- `src/components/SamplesGallery.tsx` – Showcase/Design Studio buttons plus “Your Projects” list with CRUD actions.
- `src/services/ShowcaseStorage.ts` – unified list output for showcase variants.

## Showcase & Gallery Actions
- Curated Showcase cards now expose `Open` + `Design Studio` controls.
- “Your Projects” section surfaces stored projects with `Open`, `Design Studio`, `Edit`, and `Delete` actions.

## Build & Preview
- Build status: succeeded (`reports/phase6-consolidate/build.log`).
- Preview status: started via `npm run preview` (`reports/phase6-consolidate/preview.log`).

## Manual Verification (not run in this session)
- Showcase tab actions → **not executed** (requires interactive preview).
- Open in Design Studio from curated project → **not executed**.
- Quick Spark create/edit/save flow → **not executed**.
- Delete user project from gallery → **not executed**.

## Unified Flow Notes
- ChatLoader now respects unified seeds (`seedId`), linking Showcase → Design Studio → Chat.
- User projects and curated showcases share the unified schema/storage, so actions remain consistent end-to-end.
