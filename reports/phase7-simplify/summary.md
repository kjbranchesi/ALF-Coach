# Phase 7 – Simplify Builder Home & Templates

## Files Updated
- `src/components/Dashboard.jsx` – single primary “Start New Project” CTA and streamlined header actions.
- `src/components/SamplesGallery.tsx` – curated cards now offer “Use this template”/“Preview” with optional advanced link, plus refreshed “Your Projects” list (Open/Edit/Delete).
- `src/pages/ProjectShowcase.tsx` – cloned template flow, delete action for stored projects, and “Advanced” design studio link.
- `src/services/ShowcaseStorage.ts` – unified listing metadata for user projects.
- `.env.local.example` – default feature flag hides Quick Spark in UI.

## Build & Preview
- Build status: succeeded (`reports/phase7-simplify/build.log`).
- Preview status: (not run in this CLI session).

## Manual Verification (recommended scenarios)
- Start New Project → Blank Studio (`/app/blueprint/new-…?skip=true`).
- Curated Showcase → “Use this template” → edit view.
- Advanced Design Studio link from Showcase (curated + stored).
- Delete from “Your Projects” removes entry from list.

## Notes
- Dashboard now presents a single creation path; Quick Spark routes remain in code but hidden.
- Templates clone into unified storage before editing, keeping Showcase and Builder aligned on one schema.
- Advanced links continue to seed Chat/Design Studio via `seedBlueprintFromUnified`.
