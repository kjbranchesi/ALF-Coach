# Phase 5 – Unified Data Model & Flow

## New Files
- `src/types/project.ts`
- `src/utils/transformers/projectTransformers.ts`
- `src/utils/seed/seedBlueprint.ts`

## Modified Files
- `.env.local.example`
- `src/AuthenticatedApp.tsx`
- `src/components/Dashboard.jsx`
- `src/components/SamplesGallery.tsx`
- `src/pages/ProjectShowcase.tsx`
- `src/services/ShowcaseStorage.ts`
- `src/features/quickstart/QuickSpark.tsx`
- `src/features/quickstart/QuickSparkActions.ts`
- `src/features/showcase/AssignmentEditor.tsx`
- `src/features/showcase/PolishPanel.tsx`
- `src/types/showcase.ts`

## Canonical Schema Notes
- All Showcase and Builder flows now rely on `UnifiedProject` (see `src/types/project.ts`) persisted through `UnifiedStorageManager`.
- Transformers map between Showcase, legacy ProjectV3, and the unified shape.
- ProjectShowcase loads unified data first, falls back to curated registry, and can seed the Design Studio blueprint via the shared helper.

## Routes & Storage
- `/app/quick-spark` and `/app/showcase/:id/edit` remain; ProjectShowcase adds “Open in Design Studio” for any unified project.
- Showcase storage delegates to `UnifiedStorageManager` for save/load/list/delete.

## Build & Preview
- Build status: succeeded (`reports/phase5-unify/build.log`).
- Preview status: started via `npm run preview` (`reports/phase5-unify/preview.log`).

## Manual Verification
- Not executed in this CLI session (recommend Quick Spark → Convert → Open in Design Studio, Assignment edits, and curated Showcase load).

## Unified Storage
- Teacher-created and curated showcases now share the `UnifiedProject` schema and storage pipeline, eliminating duplicate local storage paths.
