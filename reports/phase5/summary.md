# Phase 5 Summary

## Test ID Presence
- `reports/phase5/standards-testid.txt` (post-change) shows the new attribute:
```
src/features/wizard/WizardV3.tsx:332:              data-testid={step.id === 'standards' ? 'standards-confirm' : undefined}
```

## Where Confirm Is Wired
- Excerpt from `reports/phase5/standards-button.txt`:
```
149:  const handleSubmit = () => {
152:      onNext();
```

## Changes Made
- Added `data-testid="standards-confirm"` to the WizardV3 Next button when `step.id === 'standards'` (`src/features/wizard/WizardV3.tsx:332`).

## E2E Status
- `npm run test:e2e:chromium -- tests/e2e/wizard-to-standards-and-deliverables.spec.ts`
  - **Failed**: Playwright reached the standards step but timed out waiting for the framework `<select>` to appear (see `reports/phase5/e2e.log`). The HTML report is available under `playwright-report/`.

## Next Steps
- Investigate why `locator('select').first()` is missing in the standards stepâ€”likely the standards framework dropdown is not rendered under the mocked/skip flow. Use the UI runner (`npm run test:e2e:ui`) to confirm visibility and adjust the test or component accordingly.
