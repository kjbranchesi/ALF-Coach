# ALF Coach Phase 3: Curriculum Enrichment - Comprehensive Plan

## Executive Summary

**Strategic Vision**: Transform ALF Coach from a basic blueprint creator into a sophisticated curriculum generation platform that produces rich, research-backed educational content comparable to industry-leading curriculum design tools.

**Current Gap Analysis**: While Phase 2 established functional conversation flow, our content generation is currently minimal (basic milestones, generic rubrics, thin PDFs). Phase 3 will implement AI-powered curriculum enrichment to generate professional-grade educational materials.

**Expected ROI**: 10x improvement in content quality and educational value, positioning ALF Coach as a premium curriculum design solution.
