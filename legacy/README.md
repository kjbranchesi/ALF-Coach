# Legacy Documents (Staged for Cleanup)

The following files were moved here because they are backups, internal planning notes, reports, or generated artifacts that aren’t required for day‑to‑day development. Safe to delete after your confirmation.

- `CHAT_INTERFACE_REDESIGN.md.backup` — backup copy of chat redesign doc
- `REDESIGN_SPECIFICATION.md.backup` — backup copy of redesign spec
- `tailwind.config.backup.js` — backup tailwind config snapshot
- `archive-backup-20250822.tar.gz` — archived bundle (large)

- `ALF_BUILDER_STABILIZATION.md`, `CHAT_*`, `CHATMVP_SPEC_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`, `CLEANUP_*`, `CODEBASE_CLEANUP_ANALYSIS.md` — historical redesign/cleanup records
- `CURRICULUM_ENRICHMENT_GUIDE.md`, `ENRICHMENT_*` — enrichment program docs not needed for core builder
- `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_VERIFICATION.md` — older plan/verification docs
- `md_inventory*.tsv` — internal markdown inventory
- `MVP_IMPLEMENTATION_BLUEPRINT.md`, `MVP_TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATION.md` — superseded MVP docs
- `WIZARD_FILES_AUDIT.md`, `WIZARD_REDESIGN_COMPLETE.md` — wizard audit/redesign history
- `PREVIEW_DEBUG_GUIDE.md` — kept for reference; move back if still used

- Generated/analysis artifacts: `audit-baseline.txt`, `bundle-analysis.json`, `dev-server.log`, `lint-report.txt`, `test-hero-transformation.html`

Notes
- No functional code moved. Only documents/config backups, analyses, and archives.
- If any doc here still serves a purpose, move it back to the root or into `docs/`.
