## Core User Flow

### 1. Landing & Authentication
```
Landing Page → Sign In (Optional) → Dashboard
```
- Optional authentication via Firebase Auth
- Guest users can use full functionality
- User data persisted in Firestore when authenticated

### 2. Project Creation Wizard
```
Vision → Subject/Scope → Students → Review → Chat Interface
```

**Key Data Captured:**
- Vision statement and project goals
- Subject areas and interdisciplinary connections
- Duration (days, weeks, months, semester)
- Student age group and context
- Location and resources

### 3. AI-Guided Chat Interface
```
Ideation (3 steps) → Journey (3 steps) → Deliverables (3 steps) → Blueprint
```

**Flow Mechanics:**
- Each step follows: `step_entry` → `step_confirm` → advance to next
- Stage completion triggers `stage_clarify` recap
- Comprehensive data capture throughout journey
- Real-time progress tracking

### 4. Blueprint Generation & Export
```
Review Generated Content → Export Options (PDF, Google Docs) → Share
```

## The ALF Process

### Core Philosophy
The Active Learning Framework emphasizes student-centered, authentic learning experiences that connect to real-world problems and community impact.

### 3 Stages, 9 Steps Structure

#### Stage 1: IDEATION (Foundation)
1. **Big Idea** - The overarching theme or concept
2. **Essential Question** - The driving inquiry that guides learning
3. **Challenge** - The authentic problem students will address

#### Stage 2: JOURNEY (Experience Design)
4. **Phases** - The learning journey broken into manageable stages
5. **Activities** - Specific learning experiences and methodologies
6. **Resources** - Tools, materials, and support needed

#### Stage 3: DELIVERABLES (Assessment & Impact)
7. **Milestones** - Key checkpoints and learning demonstrations
8. **Rubric** - Assessment criteria and success measures
9. **Impact Plan** - Real-world application and community connection

### AI Conversation Design
- **Contextual Awareness**: AI maintains full context from wizard through completion
- **Pedagogical Guidance**: Built-in educational best practices
- **Age-Appropriate**: Content adapts based on student age groups
- **Iterative Refinement**: Support for revision and improvement

---

## Recent Fixes & Current State

### Critical Issues Resolved (December 2024)

#### 1. Chat Flow Progression Bug (FIXED)
**Issue**: After completing Big Idea, system would loop back instead of progressing to Essential Question.

**Root Cause**: State synchronization issues in `chat-service.ts`
- `handleContinue()` method wasn't properly persisting step advancement
- `advanceToNext()` had race conditions with state updates
- UI wasn't reflecting internal state changes

**Solution Implemented**:
```typescript
// Enhanced state management in chat-service.ts
private async handleContinue(): Promise<void> {
  if (this.state.phase === 'step_confirm' && this.state.pendingValue) {
    const currentStep = this.getCurrentStep();
    
    // Save the value
    this.state.capturedData[currentStep.key] = this.state.pendingValue;
    this.state.pendingValue = null;
    
    // Update completed steps counter
    this.state.completedSteps++;
    
    // Emit state change to ensure UI updates
    this.emit('stateChange', this.getState());
    
    // Now advance to next step
    await this.advanceToNext();
  }
}
```

**Verification**: All 9 steps now progress correctly from Ideation through Deliverables.

#### 2. Enhanced Process Cards & Subject Selection
**Improvements**:
- Refined ALF Process overview cards for better clarity
- Enhanced subject selector with comprehensive categorization
- Improved visual hierarchy and information architecture

### Current Operational Status

#### ✅ Working Systems
- Complete wizard flow (4 steps)
- All 9 chat steps progression
- AI conversation generation
- Data persistence (local storage + Firestore)
- PDF export functionality
- Responsive design (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- Dark mode support

#### ⚠️ Areas Requiring Monitoring
- AI API rate limiting during peak usage
- Long conversation memory management
- Error recovery for network interruptions
