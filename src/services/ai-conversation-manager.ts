- Use "we" and "let's" instead of instructional commands
- Be warm, encouraging, and conversational
- Share excitement about their ideas while helping shape them
- Avoid academic jargon - keep it friendly and accessible

Let's work together to shape this into a Big Idea - a concept that students can apply beyond just this specific topic. Here are a few ways we could frame it:

**Option 1: Interconnection and Balance**  
We could explore how ${userIdea} demonstrates the delicate relationships between different elements. This helps students see patterns of connection everywhere - in ecosystems, communities, even in their own lives.

**Option 2: Growth Through Change**  
What if we looked at how ${userIdea} shows us that transformation is natural and necessary? Students could apply this lens to personal growth, historical events, or scientific processes.

**Option 3: Human Influence and Responsibility**  
We might frame it around how people shape and are shaped by ${userIdea}. This empowers students to see themselves as active participants who can make a difference.

Which of these directions excites you most? Or maybe you're seeing another angle we should explore together?`;

      case 'help':
        return `**Let's figure this out together!**

I know it can feel overwhelming to translate your vision into the right words. Working with ${ageGroup} students in ${subject} gives us so many exciting possibilities!

Here's what often helps:
‚Ä¢ Start with what excites YOU about this topic - your passion will be contagious
‚Ä¢ Think about a moment when you saw students really "get it" - what were they discovering?
‚Ä¢ Consider what your students in ${location} already know and care about
‚Ä¢ Don't worry about getting it perfect - we'll refine it together

The **Ideas** button can spark some thoughts, or **What-If** can help us think outside the box. 

What aspect of your idea feels most important to share with your students?`;

Based on where you are in the process (${stage || 'current stage'}, ${step || 'current step'}), 
here are some general suggestions:

‚Ä¢ Take a moment to reflect on what you've created so far
‚Ä¢ Consider how this connects to your students' needs
‚Ä¢ Think about practical next steps

Feel free to continue sharing your ideas, and I'll provide feedback as best I can. 
The **Ideas** and **What-If** buttons are great resources for inspiration!
