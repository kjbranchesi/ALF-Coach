**2. Essential Question** - We'll formulate an open-ended inquiry that drives sustained investigation
**3. Challenge** - We'll design an authentic task with real-world relevance and impact

This systematic approach ensures your learning experience is grounded in research-based principles of engagement and deep learning. Each element scaffolds the next, creating coherent progression.

Let's begin by identifying your Big Idea.`,
      
      JOURNEY: `**Welcome to the Journey Design Stage**

Having established your conceptual foundation, we'll now architect the learning progression. This stage focuses on three critical design elements:

**1. Phases** - Strategic sequencing that builds complexity and deepens understanding progressively
**2. Activities** - Evidence-based learning experiences that promote active construction of knowledge
**3. Resources** - Carefully curated materials and supports that scaffold student success

As an instructional designer, you'll apply principles of backward design and differentiated instruction to create a coherent learning arc. Each decision should align with your established Big Idea and Essential Question.

Shall we begin mapping your learning journey?`,
      
      DELIVERABLES: `**Welcome to the Deliverables Stage**

In this final design phase, we'll establish how students demonstrate mastery and create authentic impact:

**1. Milestones** - Strategic checkpoints that provide formative feedback and maintain momentum
**2. Rubric** - Transparent criteria that value both process and product while promoting growth
**3. Impact Plan** - Authentic audience engagement that validates student work beyond traditional assessment

This stage transforms learning from academic exercise to meaningful contribution. By connecting to real audiences and purposes, we elevate student work to professional standards.

Let's design assessment that inspires excellence.`
