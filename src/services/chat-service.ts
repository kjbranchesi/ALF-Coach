**2. Essential Question** - We'll formulate an open-ended inquiry that drives sustained investigation
**3. Challenge** - We'll design an authentic task with real-world relevance and impact

Having established your conceptual foundation, we'll now architect the learning progression. This stage focuses on three critical design elements:

**1. Phases** - Strategic sequencing that builds complexity and deepens understanding progressively
**2. Activities** - Evidence-based learning experiences that promote active construction of knowledge
**3. Resources** - Carefully curated materials and supports that scaffold student success

As an instructional designer, you'll apply principles of backward design and differentiated instruction to create a coherent learning arc. Each decision should align with your established Big Idea and Essential Question.

Shall we begin mapping your learning journey?`,

In this final design phase, we'll establish how students demonstrate mastery and create authentic impact:

**1. Milestones** - Strategic checkpoints that provide formative feedback and maintain momentum
**2. Rubric** - Transparent criteria that value both process and product while promoting growth
**3. Impact Plan** - Authentic audience engagement that validates student work beyond traditional assessment

This stage transforms learning from academic exercise to meaningful contribution. By connecting to real audiences and purposes, we elevate student work to professional standards.

Let's design assessment that inspires excellence.`

â€¢ Provokes intellectual curiosity and sustained inquiry

Considering your ${this.wizardData.ageGroup} students in ${this.wizardData.location}, what overarching concept could transform their relationship with ${this.wizardData.subject}?

â€¢ They connect abstract concepts to concrete experiences
â€¢ They remain relevant throughout the learning journey

Building on your Big Idea, what question would compel your ${this.wizardData.ageGroup} students to think critically and creatively?

The Active Learning Framework (ALF) synthesizes decades of educational research into a practical design process. Our approach transforms traditional instruction into inquiry-driven, student-centered experiences.

**Our Three-Stage Process:**

**Ideation** (10 minutes) - Establish conceptual foundations using Understanding by Design principles. We identify transferable concepts, craft essential questions, and design authentic challenges that connect ${this.wizardData.subject} to real-world contexts.

**Journey** (15 minutes) - Apply learning sciences research to design progressive skill development. We structure phases for cognitive growth, select evidence-based activities, and curate resources that support differentiated instruction.

**Deliverables** (10 minutes) - Implement authentic assessment strategies. We establish formative milestones, develop growth-oriented rubrics, and create venues for public exhibition of learning.

**Evidence-Based Benefits:**
â€¢ Increases intrinsic motivation through autonomy and purpose
â€¢ Develops 21st-century competencies: critical thinking, collaboration, communication, creativity
â€¢ Connects academic content to community contexts in ${this.wizardData.location}
â€¢ Supports diverse learners through multiple pathways to success
â€¢ Aligns with standards while transcending test preparation

â€¢ Require higher-order thinking (analysis, synthesis, evaluation)
â€¢ Connect disciplinary knowledge to authentic contexts
â€¢ Generate additional questions rather than definitive answers

**Pedagogical principle:** As Heidi Hayes Jacobs notes, Essential Questions should be "arguable" - promoting discussion and multiple perspectives rather than convergent thinking.

Reflect: What question about ${this.wizardData.subject} would sustain investigation across your entire unit?

The Ideas feature offers questions aligned with best practices in inquiry-based learning.`,
      
      'Challenge': `**Creating Authentic Challenges**

Authentic challenges transform abstract learning into concrete contribution. Research on project-based learning demonstrates that effective challenges for ${this.wizardData.ageGroup} students:

â€¢ Address genuine needs within ${this.wizardData.location} community
â€¢ Require application of ${this.wizardData.subject} concepts in novel contexts
â€¢ Result in products valued beyond classroom assessment

**Evidence-based principle:** Buck Institute's Gold Standard PBL emphasizes that authentic challenges should have "public products" - work shared with audiences who have genuine interest in the outcomes.

Consider: What challenge would position your students as knowledge creators rather than knowledge consumers?

The Ideas feature provides challenge formats proven effective in similar educational contexts.`
