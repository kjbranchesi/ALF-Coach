## Transition Logic

### Moving Between Phases
- User must provide valid input for current phase before advancing
- "Continue to [Next Phase]" button appears after valid input
- Can always go back to refine previous phases

### Validation Rules
- **Big Idea**: Must be substantive (>3 words), not a question
- **Essential Question**: Must be open-ended, typically starts with How/Why/What
- **Challenge**: Must be actionable, specific enough to guide but open to interpretation

### What-If Scenarios
When user wants to change a previous element:
```
Coach: "I see you want to refine your [element]. This would affect..."
[Show impact visualization]

Cards:
[üí≠ Show What Changes] [‚úÖ Accept Changes] [‚ùå Keep Original]
