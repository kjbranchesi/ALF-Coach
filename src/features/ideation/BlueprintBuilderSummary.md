# Blueprint Builder v1.0 - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Blueprint Builder replaces the free-form conversational interface with a structured, predictable state machine that follows the exact specification provided.

## Key Features

### 1. Rigid State Machine
- 11 states from `ONBOARDING_INPUT` to `PUBLISH`
- Predictable flow with clear transitions
- No looping or confusion - each state has a specific purpose

### 2. Structured Data Collection
| Field | Type | State | Validation |
|-------|------|-------|------------|
| motivation | string | ONBOARDING_INPUT | Required |
| subject | string | ONBOARDING_INPUT | Required |
| ageGroup | string | ONBOARDING_INPUT | Required |
| location | string | ONBOARDING_INPUT | Optional |
| scope | enum | ONBOARDING_INPUT | Lesson/Unit/Course |
| bigIdea | string | IDEATION_BIG_IDEA | Max 10 words |
| essentialQuestion | string | IDEATION_ESSENTIAL_QUESTION | Must end with ? |
| challenge | string | IDEATION_CHALLENGE | Must start with verb |
| phases | array | JOURNEY_PHASES | Min 2 phases |
| activities | object | JOURNEY_ACTIVITIES | Min 1 per phase |
| resources | array | JOURNEY_RESOURCES | Optional |
| milestones | array | DELIVER_MILESTONES | Min 2 |
| rubric | object | DELIVER_RUBRIC | Required |
| impactPlan | string | DELIVER_IMPACT | Required |

### 3. Decision Chips
Available in exact order when relevant:
- **Get Ideas** - Context-aware suggestions based on educator inputs
- **See Examples** - Markdown table with 2 exemplars
- **Help** - 40-word explanation of current state
- **Skip** - Only for optional fields

### 4. Personalized Suggestions
- Analyzes educator's motivation text for key themes
- Generates Big Ideas that match their interests + subject
- No hardcoded themes - truly dynamic
- Blends educator interests with pedagogical best practices

### 5. Progress Tracking
- Shows "n/11 fields complete" in sidebar
- Real-time updates as fields are filled
- Visual progress bar
- Current blueprint preview

### 6. Text Style Rules
- Headings: `###` sentence-case
- Bold for variables: **{subject}**
- Italics for instructions: *Type your response*
- Max 120 words per message
- Confirmation after each field: "*Saved!* **bigIdea** â†’ *Systems Thinking*"

## Usage

```jsx
import BlueprintBuilder from './features/ideation/BlueprintBuilder';

<BlueprintBuilder
  onComplete={(ideationData) => {
    // ideationData contains all collected fields
    console.log(ideationData.bigIdea);
    console.log(ideationData.essentialQuestion);
    console.log(ideationData.challenge);
    // ... plus phases, activities, resources, etc.
  }}
  onCancel={() => {
    // Handle cancel
  }}
/>
```

## State Flow Example

1. **ONBOARDING_INPUT**
   - "Let's capture your vision in 5 quick fields..."
   - Collects: motivation, subject, age, location, scope

2. **ONBOARDING_CONFIRM**
   - Shows what was heard
   - Confirm or Edit buttons

3. **IDEATION_BIG_IDEA**
   - Shows 3 personalized Big Ideas based on motivation
   - Pick number or type own (max 10 words)

4. **IDEATION_ESSENTIAL_QUESTION**
   - Craft compelling question
   - Must end with ?

5. **IDEATION_CHALLENGE**
   - Define authentic challenge
   - Must start with action verb

... continues through all 11 states to PUBLISH

## Benefits Over Previous System

1. **Predictable** - No more looping or confusion
2. **Structured** - All data collected systematically
3. **Personalized** - Still adapts to educator interests
4. **Efficient** - Clear progress, no wasted time
5. **Complete** - Ensures all required fields are filled

## Testing

The system has been integrated into MainWorkspace and replaces ConversationalIdeationStructured when the ideation wizard is triggered.
