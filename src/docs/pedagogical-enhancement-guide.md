# Pedagogical Enhancement Framework for ALF Coach

## Overview

This guide provides educators with research-based strategies for implementing the enhanced ALF Coach prompt system, which integrates deep pedagogical foundations into conversational curriculum design.

## Theoretical Foundations

### Core Learning Theories Integrated

#### 1. Constructivist Learning Theory (Piaget & Vygotsky)
- **Application**: Students build new understanding by connecting concepts to prior knowledge
- **ALF Integration**: Big Ideas activate existing schema while Essential Questions create cognitive dissonance
- **Prompt Enhancement**: Questions scaffold from concrete to abstract thinking

#### 2. Zone of Proximal Development (Vygotsky)
- **Application**: Learning occurs in the zone between what students can do alone vs. with support
- **ALF Integration**: Activities are designed with appropriate challenge level and scaffolding
- **Prompt Enhancement**: Developmental considerations guide complexity and support structures

#### 3. Universal Design for Learning (UDL)
- **Application**: Multiple means of representation, engagement, and expression
- **ALF Integration**: Activities offer varied pathways for learning and demonstration
- **Prompt Enhancement**: Built-in accommodation and extension options

#### 4. Bloom's Revised Taxonomy
- **Application**: Systematic progression from lower to higher-order thinking
- **ALF Integration**: Phases scaffold cognitive complexity intentionally
- **Prompt Enhancement**: Question stems target appropriate cognitive levels

#### 5. Webb's Depth of Knowledge (DOK)
- **Application**: Strategic thinking complexity appropriate to developmental stage
- **ALF Integration**: Essential Questions target appropriate DOK levels
- **Prompt Enhancement**: Age-appropriate cognitive demand expectations
