Let's design the learning arc for your Environmental Science journey with 14-16 years students.

Think of 3-4 phases that guide students from initial wonder to confident application. Each phase should feel like a natural step in their growth.

**Here are three inspiring approaches:**

**A) Classic Inquiry Arc**
1. Discover & Wonder - Spark curiosity through exploration
2. Investigate & Create - Deep dive and hands-on making  
3. Share & Reflect - Present learning and celebrate growth

**B) Design Thinking Journey**
1. Empathize & Define - Understand the challenge deeply
2. Ideate & Prototype - Generate solutions and test ideas
3. Implement & Iterate - Refine and share with the world

**C) Story-Based Adventure**
1. Setting the Scene - Establish context and build excitement
2. Rising Action - Tackle challenges and build skills
3. Climax & Resolution - Apply learning to solve the big challenge
4. New Beginnings - Reflect and imagine future possibilities

You can choose A, B, or C, mix elements from each, or create your own unique progression. What resonates with your vision?

Let's step back and admire the learning journey you've designed!

**Your Environmental Science Journey Overview:**
• 2 thoughtfully crafted phases
• 2 engaging activities
• 1 enriching resources

**The Learning Arc:**
1. **Discover & Wonder** - Spark curiosity
2. **Investigate & Create** - Deep dive

This journey embodies your vision: "I want to help students see real-world applications of science"

**Reflection prompts:**
• How will students feel at each phase of this journey?
• What moments of discovery and joy have you built in?
• Where might students surprise themselves with what they can do?

Would you like to refine any part of the journey, or shall we move forward to implementation planning?
