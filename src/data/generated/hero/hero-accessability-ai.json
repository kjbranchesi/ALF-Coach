    "overview": "Every day, students with disabilities encounter digital barriers that exclude them from learning. Videos without captions leave deaf students behind. Images without alt-text make content invisible to blind students. Complex language excludes students with cognitive differences. This project transforms students into accessibility champions who use AI to audit their entire school's digital presence and fix it. They discover that their school website has 10,000 images without descriptions, that 90% of classroom videos lack captions, and that critical documents are written at college reading levels. Armed with AI tools and human judgment, students don't just identify problems - they solve them at scale, creating systems that ensure no student is ever locked out of learning again.",
    "learningObjectives": [
      "Master AI tools for generating captions, alt-text, and plain language summaries while understanding their limitations",
      "Develop deep understanding of accessibility standards (WCAG) and disability rights in education",
      "Learn to audit digital content systematically and prioritize fixes based on impact",
      "Create sustainable workflows that embed accessibility into content creation from the start",
      "Build empathy and advocacy skills by centering the experiences of disabled users"
    ],
    "methodology": "Students operate as an accessibility task force, combining automated tools with human expertise. They start by experiencing barriers themselves through simulation, then partner with disabled students and staff to understand real needs. Using AI as a force multiplier, they process thousands of media files, but always with human review to ensure quality and catch AI mistakes. The project transforms from fixing past mistakes to preventing future ones, as students create playbooks, train staff, and build systems that make accessibility automatic, not an afterthought.",
    "expectedOutcomes": [
      "Students remediate 1000+ videos with accurate captions and 5000+ images with meaningful alt-text",
      "School achieves WCAG AA compliance, opening education to all students regardless of ability",
      "District adopts student-created accessibility playbook as official policy",
      "Staff trained in accessibility-first content creation reduce future barriers by 90%",
      "Students with disabilities report dramatic improvement in access to educational materials",
      "Model spreads to other schools as blueprint for systematic accessibility improvement"

  },
  "context": {
    "problem": "Schools are failing students with disabilities through inaccessible digital content. Despite legal requirements (ADA, Section 508), most educational materials remain inaccessible. Teachers upload PDFs that screen readers can't parse. Videos lack captions, excluding deaf students. Complex language barriers affect students with cognitive disabilities, English learners, and those with reading difficulties. Meanwhile, schools face lawsuits for discrimination, but lack the resources to manually fix thousands of files. The result: students with disabilities are systematically excluded from digital learning.",
    "significance": "With 15% of students having disabilities and digital learning now essential, accessibility is a civil rights issue. AI offers unprecedented opportunity to fix accessibility at scale, but requires human oversight to ensure quality. This project positions students at the intersection of technology and social justice, developing both technical skills and empathy. By making their school a model of digital inclusion, students create ripple effects that influence district policy, vendor requirements, and cultural attitudes toward disability.",
    "realWorld": "Students work with their school's actual digital content: real websites with missing alt-text, real classroom videos without captions, real documents that exclude students. Their work has immediate impact - a blind student can suddenly access the school newspaper, a deaf student can watch the morning announcements, a student with dyslexia can understand the student handbook. When students present to the school board, they show before/after examples that make the impact undeniable.",
    "studentRole": "Students become accessibility consultants and advocates. They conduct audits, manage remediation projects, train staff, write policies, and most importantly, amplify the voices of disabled students. They're not just fixing technical problems - they're changing culture, ensuring their school community understands that accessibility benefits everyone: captions help in noisy environments, plain language helps stressed parents, good contrast helps aging teachers.",
    "authenticity": "Every file students fix helps a real person. They work with real deadlines (compliance requirements), real constraints (budget, time), and real users who provide feedback on whether their \"fixes\" actually help. When their AI generates bad alt-text that says \"image of something,\" they see how that fails a blind student. When their plain language summary loses critical meaning, they understand the balance between simplicity and accuracy. Success is measured not in files processed but in barriers removed."
