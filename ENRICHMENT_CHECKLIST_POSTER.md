## ⚡ THE 5-MINUTE QUALITY CHECK

**Can answer YES to all 4? → Project is probably ready!**

1. **Learning Test:** Read outcomes.core aloud. Do you hear analysis/design/evaluation verbs?
2. **Handout Test:** Could you give Assignment A1 to students tomorrow as-is?
3. **Assessment Test:** Could you grade student work using the microRubric?
4. **Teacher Test:** Does planningNotes tell you what to prep and when?

## 🚫 THE VETO LIST (Any ONE of these = NOT READY)

- [ ] outcomes.core only lists deliverables (no learning verbs) → **VETO**
- [ ] ANY studentDirections use vague verbs: "Work on," "Research," "Explore" → **VETO**
- [ ] NO microRubric present → **VETO**
- [ ] noTechFallback is empty → **VETO**
- [ ] <20% of weeks have checkpoints → **VETO**
- [ ] safetyEthics missing despite hands-on work → **VETO**
- [ ] successCriteria are compliance-based: "Turned in on time," "Good effort" → **VETO**

**If ANY veto triggered → Back to enrichment!**

## 💡 REMEMBER THE GOLDEN RULES

1. **Be specific.** Replace every vague verb.
2. **Student voice.** All successCriteria say "I can..."
3. **Never empty.** noTechFallback is equity non-negotiable.
4. **Add checkpoints.** Formative assessment prevents disasters.
5. **Learning first.** Outcomes describe learning, not just making.
6. **Use templates.** Don't reinvent—copy and customize.
7. **Test usability.** Could a new teacher implement tomorrow?
8. **Safety matters.** Hands-on work needs safety protocols.
9. **AI guidance.** Help teachers navigate integration confidently.
10. **Calibrate often.** Peer review every 3 projects.
