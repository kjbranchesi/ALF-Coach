# Need‑To‑Know Reports

Focused, high‑signal reports that capture incidents, irreversible decisions, and integration playbooks. Use this folder for artifacts you’ll want in 3–12 months without digging through commits or Slack.

Recommended format for new reports:
- Title, Date, Owner
- Context and Impact (one short paragraph)
- Root Cause (bullet points)
- Actions Taken (bullet points)
- Current State (one short paragraph)
- Guardrails and Runbooks (bullet points)
- Re‑enable/Extend Plan (optional)

See the PDF vendor incident AAR for a canonical example.
