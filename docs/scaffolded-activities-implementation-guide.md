```

### 3. Real-Time Adaptation

**Progress-Based Adaptation**:
```typescript
const adaptedActivity = await scaffoldingService.adaptActivitiesForProgress(
  activityId,
  progressData,
  context
);
```

**Live Suggestions**:
```typescript
const liveSuggestions = await scaffoldingService.provideLiveScaffoldingSuggestions(
  currentInput,
  context
);
```

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Core Integration

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Ensure TypeScript types are available
   npm install --save-dev @types/node
   ```

2. **Initialize Services**
   ```typescript
   // In your main service initialization
   const objectivesEngine = new LearningObjectivesEngine();
   const standardsEngine = new StandardsAlignmentEngine();
   const bloomsEngine = new BloomsTaxonomyEngine();
   
   const scaffoldingService = new ScaffoldingIntegrationService(
     objectivesEngine,
     standardsEngine,
     bloomsEngine
   );
   ```

3. **Update Conversation Flow**
   ```typescript
   // In conversation handlers
   const scaffoldingContext = {
     conversationStage: 'ideation',
     currentObjectives: extractedObjectives,
     studentProfile: userProfile,
     instructionalPreferences: preferences,
     curriculumConstraints: constraints
   };
   
   const activities = await scaffoldingService.generateContextualActivities(
     scaffoldingContext
   );
   ```

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features

1. **Add Progress Tracking**
   ```typescript
   const progressData = {
     completedActivities: userProgress.completed,
     masteryLevels: userProgress.mastery,
     strugglingAreas: userProgress.struggles,
     acceleratedAreas: userProgress.advanced,
     engagementIndicators: userProgress.engagement
   };
   ```

2. **Implement Activity Sequences**
   ```typescript
   const sequence = await scaffoldingService.createLearningProgression(
     objectives,
     context
   );
   ```

3. **Add Cultural Responsiveness**
   ```typescript
   const culturalElements = {
     dimension: 'community_connections',
     description: 'Connect to student communities',
     implementation: ['local examples', 'family engagement'],
     resources: ['community experts', 'cultural materials']
   };
   ```

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

1. **Cognitive Load Management**
   ```typescript
   const cognitiveAssessment = {
     intrinsicLoad: 'medium',
     extraneousLoad: 'low',
     germaneLoad: 'high',
     totalLoad: 'manageable',
     recommendations: ['chunk information', 'provide scaffolds']
   };
   ```

2. **Zone of Proximal Development Analysis**
   ```typescript
   const zpdAnalysis = {
     currentLevel: 'concrete operations',
     nextLevel: 'formal operations',
     supportNeeded: ['visual supports', 'peer collaboration'],
     indicatorsOfReadiness: ['abstract thinking', 'hypothesis formation'],
     scaffoldingGradient: ['guided practice', 'peer support', 'independent work']
   };
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Activity Generation

```typescript
// Generate scaffolded activities for a math objective
const mathObjective = {
  id: 'math_001',
  statement: 'Students will solve multi-step word problems involving addition and subtraction',
  bloomsLevel: 'apply',
  subject: 'mathematics',
  ageGroup: 'elementary',
  standardsAlignment: [/* standards */]
};

const context = {
  conversationStage: 'journey',
  currentObjectives: [mathObjective],
  studentProfile: {
    ageGroup: 'elementary',
    learningPreferences: ['visual', 'kinesthetic'],
    accommodationNeeds: ['extended time', 'visual supports'],
    priorKnowledge: ['basic addition', 'basic subtraction'],
    challengeAreas: ['word problems', 'multi-step reasoning'],
    strengths: ['number sense', 'pattern recognition']
  },
  instructionalPreferences: {
    scaffoldingIntensity: 'moderate',
    modalityPreferences: ['visual', 'kinesthetic'],
    assessmentFrequency: 'regular',
    technologyIntegration: 'medium',
    collaborationLevel: 'pairs',
    culturalResponsiveness: 'moderate'
  },
  curriculumConstraints: {
    timeConstraints: '45 minutes',
    materialsBudget: 'moderate',
    spaceLimitations: ['classroom only'],
    technologyAvailability: ['tablets', 'interactive whiteboard'],
    supportStaffAvailable: true,
    classSize: 24
  }
};

const recommendations = await scaffoldingService.generateContextualActivities(context);
```

### Activity Adaptation

```typescript
// Adapt activity based on student progress
const progressData = {
  completedActivities: ['activity_001', 'activity_002'],
  masteryLevels: new Map([['math_001', 0.6]]),
  strugglingAreas: ['word_problems'],
  acceleratedAreas: ['number_operations'],
  engagementIndicators: new Map([['math_001', 0.8]])
};

const adaptedActivity = await scaffoldingService.adaptActivitiesForProgress(
  'activity_001',
  progressData,
  context
);
```

### Learning Progression

```typescript
// Create a learning progression for multiple objectives
const objectives = [
  basicAdditionObjective,
  basicSubtractionObjective,
  wordProblemObjective,
  multiStepProblemObjective
];

const progression = await scaffoldingService.createLearningProgression(
  objectives,
  context
);

console.log(`Total duration: ${progression.totalDuration}`);
console.log(`Checkpoints: ${progression.checkpoints.join(', ')}`);
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Scaffolding Intensity Selection

- **Light**: For confident learners with strong prior knowledge
- **Moderate**: For typical classroom implementation
- **Intensive**: For learners with significant support needs

### 2. Modality Selection

- **Visual**: Students who benefit from graphic organizers and visual supports
- **Auditory**: Students who learn through discussion and verbal processing
- **Kinesthetic**: Students who need movement and hands-on experiences
- **Multimodal**: Default for diverse classrooms

### 3. Assessment Frequency

- **Minimal**: For formative-light environments
- **Regular**: Standard classroom implementation
- **Frequent**: For intervention or intensive support contexts

### 4. Cultural Responsiveness

- **Basic**: Acknowledge cultural diversity
- **Moderate**: Include culturally relevant examples
- **Extensive**: Deep integration of cultural assets and community connections

## Error Handling

```typescript
try {
  const activities = await scaffoldingService.generateContextualActivities(context);
  return activities;
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Scaffolding generation failed', { error, context });
  
  // Fallback to basic activity suggestions
  return generateBasicActivities(context.currentObjectives);
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy

```typescript
// Activities are automatically cached by context
const cacheKey = generateCacheKey(context);
const cachedActivities = activityCache.get(cacheKey);

if (cachedActivities) {
  return cachedActivities;
}
```

### Async Processing

```typescript
// Generate activities asynchronously for better performance
const activityPromises = objectives.map(objective => 
  generateActivityForObjective(objective, context)
);

const activities = await Promise.all(activityPromises);
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests

```typescript
describe('ScaffoldedActivitiesGenerator', () => {
  test('generates appropriate scaffolding levels', async () => {
    const generator = new ScaffoldedActivitiesGenerator();
    const activities = await generator.generateActivities(testRequest);
    
    expect(activities).toHaveLength(1);
    expect(activities[0].scaffoldingLevel.supportLevel).toBe('moderate');
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests

```typescript
describe('ScaffoldingIntegrationService', () => {
  test('provides contextual recommendations', async () => {
    const service = new ScaffoldingIntegrationService(
      mockObjectivesEngine,
      mockStandardsEngine,
      mockBloomsEngine
    );
    
    const recommendations = await service.generateContextualActivities(context);
    expect(recommendations).toBeDefined();
    expect(recommendations[0].rationale).toContain('developmental needs');
  });
});
```
