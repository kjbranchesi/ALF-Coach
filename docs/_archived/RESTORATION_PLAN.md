## 🔧 Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Learning Journey Enhancement
```jsx
// Add coaching prompts like:
"Let's map out the learning adventure! What are the major phases students will experience?"

// Suggestion cards:
"🚀 Start with Discovery Phase"
"🔍 Add an Investigation Phase"
"🎨 Include a Creation Phase"
"🎯 End with Presentation Phase"
```

### Phase 2: Deliverables Coaching
```jsx
// Conversational rubric building:
"What skills do you want students to demonstrate? I'll help you create clear criteria."

// Milestone suggestions:
"📍 Week 1: Project Launch & Team Formation"
"📍 Week 3: First Prototype Review"
"📍 Week 5: Peer Feedback Session"
```

### Phase 3: Polish Everything
- Apply soft UI shadows consistently
- Add hover effects to all interactive elements
- Ensure white text on blue backgrounds
- Add celebration moments throughout

## 📝 Quick Wins We Can Do Now

1. **Fix all user message colors** - Update all Message components to use prose-invert
2. **Add soft shadows everywhere** - Apply shadow-soft classes to all cards
3. **Restore progress sidebars** - Add IdeationProgress-like components to other stages
4. **Coaching messages** - Replace empty states with encouraging prompts

## 🎨 Design Tokens to Apply Everywhere

```css
/* Shadows */
.shadow-soft: Default cards
.shadow-soft-lg: Hovered cards
.shadow-soft-xl: Important elements

/* Colors */
Blue gradient: from-blue-600 to-blue-700 (user messages)
White with shadows: AI messages
Amber-500: Focus rings and highlights

/* Animations */
whileHover={{ scale: 1.02, y: -2 }}
transition={{ type: "spring", stiffness: 400, damping: 17 }}
```

## 💡 Coaching Philosophy to Restore

1. **Never interrogate** - Always guide and suggest
2. **Celebrate progress** - Acknowledge every step
3. **Offer alternatives** - "What if" is powerful
4. **Show examples** - Concrete ideas inspire
5. **Stay encouraging** - Positive language throughout

## 🚀 Next Action

Should we start with enhancing the Learning Journey stage to match the restored Ideation experience? This would give educators a consistent, coaching-focused experience across the first two critical stages.
