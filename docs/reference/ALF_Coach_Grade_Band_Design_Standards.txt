Grade band
Developmental focus & hallmark learning behaviors
Cognitive expectations (typical)
Authentic task types that work
K–2
Curiosity, talk‑to‑learn, play‑based sense‑making; emerging self‑regulation; concrete experiences; strong need for routine and belonging.
Observe/describe; sort & classify; simple cause–effect; make & use drawings/models; begin to plan & test with adult scaffolds; early collaboration norms.
Class “expert museum”; sensory installation; habitat build; rule‑based playground redesign; picture‑book science explainers; simple data walks (tally & compare).

Band
Time‑on‑task stamina & session design*
Supervision ratios (typical baselines)**
Tool/material limits & lab setup
Fieldwork & permissions
K–2
10–20‑min mini‑cycles (explore‑make‑share); 60–90‑min total block with movement breaks; stamina builds across project.
Classroom: 1 adult per class; add aides for stations. Field trips: commonly ~1:5 (grades 1–2), defer to host/district.
Paper/cardboard, craft tools, snap circuits (3V), droppers, magnifiers; no open flames/corrosives; PPE for any 'wet' work; clear station rules.
Guardian trip consent; follow district media‑release policies; avoid platforms that collect personal data for <13 (COPPA).
3–5
20–30‑min cycles; 90–120‑min block or two 45‑min periods.
Field trips: often ~1:10; reduce to 1:5 for high‑stimulus sites; follow venue requirements.
Add hand tools (manual screwdrivers, hand drills, safety knives under rules), low‑temp glue guns; goggles normal; avoid student use of hazardous power tools.
For surveys/interviews, avoid sensitive topics or obtain guardian consent (PPRA); share only de‑identified data.
6–8
30–45‑min work blocks; 90–150‑min total.
Field trips: ~1:10 to 1:15 common; follow host rules and risk assessment.
Add soldering with fume management; Dremel/rotary tools with close supervision; no student operation of prohibited power‑driven equipment; training + PPE required.
If findings will be published or generalized with a partner (e.g., university), check whether activity requires IRB determination; confirm data privacy protocols.
9–12
45–90‑min blocks; extended studio/lab days work well.
Field trips: ~1:15 typical at museums; tighten ratios for field sampling or fabrication sites.
CNC/laser/3D printers after training & badging; keep minors off hazardous power‑driven machinery per youth‑employment guidance; enforce occupancy and PPE.
Data privacy: ensure FERPA/COPPA compliance for platforms; obtain consent for media/publication; MoUs with partners for data handling.
* Session ranges are design guidelines grounded in learning‑science and EF development; adjust for class length and student needs.
** Always defer to your district/venue; examples from major museums and venues commonly range from ~1:5 (young) to ~1:10–1:15 (older).
3) Typical durations, pacing, milestones, and realistic artifacts
Sustained projects commonly run from ~1 week to a semester; many cluster in the 2–6 week range depending on band and scope. Start shorter if your context is new to PBL.

Language access: use WIDA Key Language Uses (Narrate, Inform, Explain, Argue) to script sentence frames and multilingual artifacts; set expectations by proficiency levels.
Embed SEL: collaboration norms, critique protocols, and reflection prompts aligned to the CASEL competencies.
Protect privacy: follow FERPA/COPPA when using platforms or publishing work; de‑identify data for public sharing; obtain consent for media.
Band‑specific inclusivity tips
K–2: Picture‑rich instructions; tactile choices; 'I can' statements with icons; multilingual family take‑homes.
3–5: Tiered research packets; sentence frames by language proficiency; roles by strength (illustrator, interviewer, builder).
6–8: Workshops on perspective‑taking; structured peer feedback; multi‑modal submission options (poster/podcast/code).
9–12: Choice of product genre; accessibility checks for public artifacts (captions, alt‑text); community‑review with translation where needed.
