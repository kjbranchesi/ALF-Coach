Quick‑Start (One Page)
Align the project to standards and a real community need; target a public product and authentic audience.
Check district policies for volunteers, field trips, procurement, student data/privacy, accessibility, and safety.
Draft a simple MOU covering roles, supervision, data/privacy, IP, insurance, timelines, and cancellation.
Before students leave campus or interact online: obtain permissions, confirm supervision ratios, finalize transportation and emergency plans, and collect a Certificate of Insurance (COI) with Additional Insured if the partner hosts on site.
Vet ed‑tech and data use for FERPA/PPRA/COPPA/CIPA compliance; use a district data privacy agreement (e.g., NDPA).
During the project: apply two‑adult/no‑1:1 rule, visible spaces, check‑in/out, and incident logging; use Check–Call–Care for injuries.
After the project: publish a public product, gather standards‑aligned evidence, thank and debrief with partners, and schedule next steps.
1) Community Partnership Frameworks
A. Finding, Vetting, and Scoping
Where to look: community schools coalitions, chambers of commerce, municipal departments, libraries, higher‑ed, CTE advisory boards, anchor employers, local NGOs, and maker/innovation hubs.
Vetting questions (use before any commitment):
Student safety: Will staff/volunteers meet district screening and youth‑protection expectations (background checks, code of conduct, two‑adult rule, mandated reporting)?
Environment: Does the site have a written safety plan, accessible facilities, and Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for chemicals/tools?
Insurance: Can the partner provide a COI and add the district as Additional Insured when hosting students?
Data: If student PII is processed, will the partner sign the NDPA/district Data Privacy Agreement?
Alignment & value: Does the work map to standards and culminate in a public product for an authentic audience?
B. Agreements (Simple MOU / Letter of Agreement)
Purpose & learning outcomes; activities, timeline, and site(s).
Roles and supervision plan (teacher(s), partner lead, chaperones, nurse contact, emergency contacts).
Youth safety & conduct (two‑adult/no 1:1; visible spaces; communication boundaries).
Data privacy & security (FERPA basis or consent; NDPA/DPA; data minimization, retention, deletion).
Media permissions and intellectual property (who owns student work; licenses for display).
Insurance/indemnification (COI; Additional Insured endorsement when applicable).
Incident response, cancellation, and review/renewal terms.
C. Volunteer Management
Written screening (application, references, background checks per district/state).
Role‑specific orientation and code of conduct; boundaries and reporting channels.
Mandated‑reporter guidance; sign‑in/out and real‑time location/attendance tracking.
Supervision expectations (no unsupervised one‑to‑one; use visible spaces).
D. Sustaining Relationships
Co‑plan annually; revisit MOUs and schedules.
Publish public products and co‑host showcases.
Share outcome snapshots and next‑year opportunities.
Recognize partners (letters, social posts per district policy, certificates).
2) Risk Management & Student Safety
A. Permission Forms (include)
Project description, locations, dates, and transportation mode.
Supervision ratio and chaperone expectations; bathroom and transition plans.
Health/medication needs and nurse contact; accessibility/504/IEP accommodations.
Emergency contacts, media permissions, risk disclosures, and data‑use notice (FERPA/PPRA).
B. Supervision Ratios (minimums—use district or stricter)
Age Band
Minimum Adult:Student Ratio (reference)
6–8
1:8
9–14
1:10
15–17
1:12
Apply a two‑adult/no 1:1 contact rule for all settings (on‑site and virtual). Use visible spaces and document communications.
C. Fieldwork Logistics
☐ Route walk‑through; ADA access verified (routes, entrances, restrooms).
☐ Cell coverage/radio plan; rally points; headcounts at every transition.
☐ First‑aid kit and trained adult assigned; post Check–Call–Care.
☐ Hazards reviewed; PPE arranged; SDS accessible (labs/shops/cleaners).
☐ Transportation rosters/seat charts; chaperone assignments; visitor badges.
☐ Nurse consult; medication delegation/training; emergency action plan (EAP).
☐ Lost‑student drill practiced; incident forms printed; parent notification protocol ready.
D. Data Privacy (ed‑tech, surveys, photos)
FERPA governs education records; disclose PII to vendors only with consent or under the school‑official exception plus a signed DPA.
PPRA covers certain surveys/mental‑health or protected topics—provide required notices/consent.
COPPA requires parental consent for under‑13 online services collecting personal information.
CIPA (for E‑Rate) requires filtering and digital citizenship education on appropriate online behavior.
Prefer vendors who will sign the NDPA or your state DPA; practice data minimization and define retention/deletion.
E. Incidental Injury & Reporting
Use Check–Call–Care; contact nurse/EMS as indicated; complete district incident form.
Head injury: follow return‑to‑learn protocols; notify families and administration promptly.
Debrief, record corrective actions, and update the risk assessment.
F. Insurance Notes (collect/confirm)
COI with general liability; Additional Insured endorsement naming the district when the partner hosts students.
Workers’ comp and auto liability as applicable; verify abuse/molestation coverage for youth‑serving programs.
Remember: a certificate alone does not grant Additional Insured status—obtain the endorsement.
3) Budgeting & Procurement
A. Typical Cost Drivers
Transportation and substitutes; accessibility supports (interpreters, captions, adaptive tools).
Safety gear/PPE; printing/fabrication; showcase/exhibition costs.
Volunteer screening and orientation; ed‑tech licenses (with DPAs).
B. Small‑Grant & In‑Kind Strategies
Local education foundation, PTA/PTO microgrants, service clubs, corporate CSR, and community foundations.
Municipal departments (libraries, parks, public works) and higher‑ed partnerships for space/equipment/expertise.
Leverage community donations with clear acceptance policies and thank‑you procedures.
C. Allowable Costs & Thresholds (Uniform Guidance)
Follow 2 CFR Part 200 and district policy.
Use documented micro‑purchases and simplified acquisitions within current thresholds; your state/district may set stricter limits.
Maintain quotes/justifications and conflict‑of‑interest disclosures; coordinate with procurement early.
4) Technology & Accessibility
A. Equitable Device/Internet Access
Plan device checkout and offline‑capable tasks; identify community Wi‑Fi (libraries/municipal).
Provide no‑tech/low‑tech pathways for essential work and assessments.
B. Acceptable Use & Protecting Minors Online
Refresh your AUP; align staff social‑media boundaries and communication channels.
Teach digital citizenship and cyberbullying awareness; log and respond to incidents.
C. Multilingual & Assistive Technologies
Offer translated family materials and interpreter access for events.
Ensure captions/transcripts, alt text, keyboard navigation, and screen‑reader compatibility for digital products.
Choose platforms aligned to WCAG 2.1 AA; plan for the DOJ Title II web/mobile accessibility timelines.
5) Assessment & Evidence
A. Authentic + Standards‑Aligned
Use the HQPBL elements to design for authenticity, inquiry, reflection, critique/revision, and public product.
Map tasks to state standards (ELA/Math/Science/CTE/SEL) and rubric language students can use.
B. Evidence Capture
Collect artifacts, performance tasks, observation notes, student reflections, and partner feedback.
Use checklists and single‑point rubrics aligned to standards and success criteria.
Maintain a short evidence tracker (who/what/standard/where stored) for quick reporting.
C. Reporting & Stakeholder Communication
Share a one‑page impact brief: who participated, what was produced, standards covered, and quotes from students/partners.
Tag outcomes to district indicators (attendance, behavior, credits, pathway milestones) and—where applicable—ESSA evidence tiers.
6) Legal & Ethical Scenarios
A. Commercialization & Sponsorships
Avoid exclusive endorsements or advertising to students; route recognition through district policy.
Use MOUs and COIs for partner‑hosted events; review gift/donation acceptance policies.
B. Intellectual Property (Student Work)
Students generally own copyright in their original work.
Clarify licenses in the MOU (e.g., non‑exclusive license for partner to display the final public product).
Consider Creative Commons for classroom publishing; obtain media permissions from families.
C. Student Entrepreneurship & Internships
For internships with for‑profit partners, ensure the learning plan is primary (Department of Labor ‘primary beneficiary’ factors).
Comply with child‑labor hour/occupation limits; do not place minors into hazardous occupations.
Coordinate placements through the CTE/Work‑Based Learning coordinator and verify insurance.
D. Hazmat/Lab/Shop Work
Follow OSHA Hazard Communication; maintain SDS on site.
Use NSTA/ACS K‑12 lab safety guidance; inventory and dispose of legacy chemicals per EPA school guidance.
Provide PPE and training; document safety briefings before activities.
7) Cross‑Age Mentorship & Inclusion
A. Pairing Grade Bands
Use near‑peer models (HS→MS/ES) with explicit goals, scripts, and deliverables.
Schedule in visible spaces; keep mentors in pairs; provide feedback mini‑lessons (warm/constructive/next).
B. Safeguarding Minors
Enforce two‑adult/no 1:1 rule and documented communications on approved platforms.
Provide mandated‑reporter reminders and clear reporting pathways (school and community partner).
C. UDL & SEL Supports
Plan multiple means of engagement, representation, and action/expression (UDL).
Build collaboration norms, restorative practices, and reflection routines into community engagements.
