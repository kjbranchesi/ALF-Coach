Some activities borderline for age; adaptations are unclear.
Activities aligned if simplified (microscale demos, pre‑prepared specimens).
Clear match to grade‑band standards and abilities.
Prior examples at this grade? Any age‑restricted materials? Relevant org guidance consulted.
Required expertise
Requires certifications the team doesn’t have (e.g., BSL‑2 microbiology; hazardous chemical operations).
Teacher has partial skills; no PD or co‑teaching plan.
Baseline skills; PD/co‑teaching plan identified.
Qualified staff already on hand; credentials current.
Who supervises? What credentials/PD will be used?
Supervision & ratios
Students work alone in lab; travel without adequate chaperones; ratios below policy.
Ratios unclear or below best practice for parts of the activity.
Ratios meet policy with trained chaperones; roles assigned.

B2. Scenario Scoring Examples
• K–2 “Neighborhood Pollinators” walk (on‑campus + garden visit): Age‑appropriateness 4; Supervision 3–4 (policy ratio met); Risk 3 (sun/traffic mitigations); Regulatory 3 (trip form/parent notice). If total ≥ 28 → Green. Use district field‑trip approvals.
• Grade 7 “Microbiome swabs of classroom surfaces”: If proposing unknown environmental cultures → Risk = 1 and **Hard‑stop**. Swap to BSL‑1 kits or sealed plates, or use virtual colony images; then Risk 3–4.
• High school “Stream water quality survey” (off‑campus): Feasible when: district trip approval; trained chaperones; water‑safety plan; vetted bus vendor; PPE (waders); comms plan. Transportation & bus‑stop safety reminders included.
• Any grade “Dissection”: Provide alternatives; follow NSTA animal/dissection policy; obtain parent notice per school policy. Score drops if no alternatives/notice.
• Any grade “Student survey on sensitive topics”: If topics fall under PPRA (e.g., political beliefs, income), parental consent/opt‑out required. Without a plan → Regulatory 1 (Hard‑stop).
C) Mitigation Playbooks for Common Red Flags
Budget overage
• Triage must‑have vs. nice‑to‑have; phase the project; seek in‑kind (district surplus, local college loans, maker‑space partnership).
• Substitute: microscale chemistry; virtual labs; sealed/prepared biological kits; reuse durable PPE.
• Align purchases with school activity‑fund rules; obtain written approvals for field‑trip costs.
Hazardous materials/chemicals
• Eliminate/substitute higher‑hazard reagents; prefer microscale; remove legacy stock via SC3/cleanout with district or state support.
• Implement engineering/admin controls: fume hood when required; GHS labels; maintain SDS; adopt a Chemical Hygiene Plan (CHP); annual review; train staff.
• Escalate: if no compliant lab or CHP exists, stop classroom use and partner with a certified lab or redesign.
Biological hazards / live organisms
• Scope to BSL‑1 only in K–12 teaching labs; do not culture unknown environmental microbes; purchase from reputable suppliers; use sealed kits; enforce hygiene.
• Animals/dissection: follow NSTA position; provide opt‑out alternatives; ensure humane care and local policy compliance.
• Escalate: any BSL‑2 plan requires documented facilities, training, signage, SOPs—typically out of scope for most schools unless partnering with a certified lab.
Data privacy / EdTech
• Minimize data; turn off analytics/ads; use district‑approved apps; only collect what’s necessary.
• Compliance: map data flows; ensure FERPA directory‑info rules; PPRA consents for protected topics; confirm COPPA parental notice/consent requirements (check latest FTC updates).
• Contracting: use your district’s DPA/NDPA addenda; limit vendor use to school purposes; prohibit secondary use.
• Escalate: loop in the district privacy officer/legal before student accounts are created.
Transportation / off‑campus travel
• Policy first: complete district forms and obtain approvals on schedule; align chaperone ratios; plan for medications (EpiPens, etc.).
• Vendor safety: use district‑approved buses; follow NHTSA guidance; pre‑brief students.
• Route planning: designate safe stops; incorporate stop‑arm/illegal passing reminders in safety talk.
Partner reliability
• Vet references, insurance, background checks if applicable, safety record.
• Document a signed MOU with roles, supervision, incident reporting, cancellation terms.
• Prepare a backup vendor/date and an on‑campus Plan B.
D) Decision Thresholds, Gates, & Escalation
Weighted thresholds (max 36):
• Green (31–36): Proceed to planning. Lock in mitigations, dates, and approvals.
• Yellow (23–30): Revise with 1–2 mitigation cycles; re‑score.
• Red (≤22) or any Hard‑stop: Do not proceed until mitigations close the gap or the concept is redesigned.
Automatic Hard‑stop gates (require admin/legal sign‑off):
• Hazardous chemicals without a compliant lab/CHP/SDS.
• Unknown microbial cultures; any BSL‑2 work in non‑certified space.
• Student data sharing with vendors without FERPA/COPPA agreements, or PPRA‑covered surveys without parent consent process.
• Overnight/out‑of‑state/international trips, water activities, or other high‑risk activities without district approvals and medical planning.
Who to loop in (and when):
• School administrators (always for off‑campus; any non‑routine risks).
• District risk management / science supervisor (chemicals, labs, shop tools).
• Student privacy officer / district legal (any new vendor collecting PI; PPRA‑covered surveys).
• Nurse/health services (medication, allergies, seizure plans; field trips).
