```

### Advanced Options

```typescript
const options = {
  targetBloomsLevels: ['understand', 'apply', 'analyze'],
  preferredFrameworks: ['CCSS', 'NGSS'],
  culturalPriorities: ['multilingual', 'community_connections'],
  technologyIntegration: true,
  collaborationEmphasis: true,
  differentiationLevel: 'extensive',
  qualityThreshold: 0.8
};

const package = await service.generateComprehensiveObjectives(
  context, 
  3, 
  options
);
```

## Core Components

### 1. Learning Objectives Engine

The foundational engine that generates SMART learning objectives with comprehensive validation.

**Key Methods:**
- `generateObjectives()`: Create new objectives from context
- `validateSMARTCriteria()`: Assess objective quality
- `generateTimeframe()`: Create appropriate timing guidance

**Example Output:**
```typescript
{
  id: "obj_12345",
  statement: "Students will be able to identify and describe three different types of mathematical patterns in their classroom environment using visual observation by the end of the lesson",
  bloomsLevel: "understand",
  dokLevel: 2,
  smartCriteria: {
    specific: { score: 0.8, evidence: ["Contains specific action verb"] },
    measurable: { score: 0.9, evidence: ["Observable behaviors"] },
    achievable: { score: 0.85, evidence: ["Age-appropriate complexity"] },
    relevant: { score: 0.9, evidence: ["Connects to big idea"] },
    timeBound: { score: 0.8, evidence: ["Clear timeframe"] },
    overallScore: 0.85
  }
}
```

### 2. Bloom's Taxonomy Engine

Provides sophisticated cognitive complexity analysis and progression planning.

**Key Features:**
- Age-appropriate Bloom's level selection
- Subject-specific verb optimization
- Multiple intelligence integration
- Scaffolding recommendations

**Example Usage:**
```typescript
const bloomsEngine = new BloomsTaxonomyEngine();

// Generate progression
const progression = bloomsEngine.generateProgression(context);

// Select optimal verb
const verb = bloomsEngine.selectOptimalVerb('analyze', context, 'logical_mathematical');

// Get assessment strategies
const strategies = bloomsEngine.getAssessmentStrategies('evaluate', context);
```

### 3. Standards Alignment Engine

Automatically suggests relevant standards and performs backward design analysis.

**Supported Frameworks:**
- Common Core State Standards (CCSS)
- Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)
- National Council for Social Studies (NCSS)
- National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM)
- International Baccalaureate (IB)
- Advanced Placement (AP)
- State and custom frameworks

**Example Usage:**
```typescript
const standardsEngine = new StandardsAlignmentEngine();

// Get alignment suggestions
const alignments = await standardsEngine.suggestAlignments(objectives, context);

// Perform backward design
const backwardDesign = await standardsEngine.performBackwardDesign(
  ['CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.3.OA.D.8'],
  context
);

// Find cross-curricular connections
const connections = await standardsEngine.findCrossCurricularConnections(
  ['CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.3.OA.D.8'],
  ['Science', 'Art']
);
```

### 4. Pedagogical Framework Engine

Integrates research-based pedagogical frameworks and cultural responsiveness.

**Supported Frameworks:**
- Universal Design for Learning (UDL)
- Culturally Responsive Teaching
- Social Constructivism
- Multiple Intelligences Theory
- Subject-specific pedagogies

**Example Usage:**
```typescript
const frameworkEngine = new PedagogicalFrameworkEngine();

// Get framework recommendations
const frameworks = await frameworkEngine.recommendFrameworks(context, objectives);

// Generate cultural adaptations
const adaptations = frameworkEngine.generateCulturalAdaptations(
  objectives, 
  context, 
  'multilingual ELL students'
);

// Create UDL enhancements
const udlEnhancements = frameworkEngine.generateUDLEnhancements(objectives, context);
```
