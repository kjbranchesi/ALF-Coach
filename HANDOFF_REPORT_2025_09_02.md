# Handoff Report — 2025-09-02

This report summarizes the final changes, where to find things, and how to verify the app. It also outlines recommended next steps and guardrails we added for safe iteration.

## Key Outcomes

- Build fix + feedback bug:
  - Added `src/components/SamplesGallery.tsx` and Dashboard “Explore Sample Project”.
  - Fixed QuickFeedback localStorage fallback payload.

- Safe cleanup + archiving:
  - Superseded How It Works page archived: `src/components/HowItWorksPage.jsx` → `src/_archived/info-pages/HowItWorksPage.jsx`.
  - Landing links to route `/how-it-works` which uses `src/pages/HowItWorks.tsx` with optional diagram slot.
  - Removed dead lazy import from `LandingPage.jsx`.
  - Duplicate components archived in `src/_archived/duplicates/`: FrameworkOverview, StageHeader, StageTransitionModal, UnifiedSuggestionCard, UserMenu, PedagogicalRationale, CurriculumOutline, SyllabusView, LiveFrameworkBuilder, FrameworkCelebration. Journey summary duplicates archived; active versions removed.

- Expanded samples (5–7 per age group):
  - Refactored `src/utils/sampleBlueprints.ts` to a programmatic catalog with consistent journeys and minimal rubric placeholders.
  - Age groups: early-elementary, elementary, middle, upper-secondary, higher-ed, adult.
  - `getAllSampleBlueprints(userId)` now returns the expanded set.

- Samples gallery polish:
  - Filters: grade-level pills + subject dropdown.
  - Preview drawer with quick details (context, big idea, EQ, challenge, journey, milestones).
  - “Copy to My Projects” (no navigation) + “Launch” (navigates). Copies refresh Dashboard via `window.refreshDashboard()` if open.

- Lint/scanner guardrails:
  - `eslint.config.js` ignores archived/generated paths and blocks imports from `_archived` via `no-restricted-imports`.
  - Added `scripts/find-unreferenced.mjs` (`npm run scan:unused`) to generate `docs/unreferenced-files.scan.csv`.
  - Added CI guard `scripts/check-no-archived-imports.mjs` + `npm run guard:archived` to fail if any non-archived code imports from `_archived`.

## Build/Run

- Dev: `npm run dev`
- Build: `npm run build` (verified green)
- Lint: `npm run lint` (noisy from older areas; not blocking)
- Guardrails:
  - `npm run guard:archived` — fails if `_archived` is imported from active code.
  - `npm run scan:unused` — writes heuristic candidate list to `docs/unreferenced-files.scan.csv`.

## Files of Interest

- Samples
  - Generator: `src/utils/sampleBlueprints.ts`
  - Gallery: `src/components/SamplesGallery.tsx`
  - Dashboard entry: `src/components/Dashboard.jsx` (Explore Sample Project)

- Feedback
  - Modal: `src/components/feedback/QuickFeedback.tsx` (fixed fallback payload)

- How It Works
  - Page: `src/pages/HowItWorks.tsx` (optional diagram slot)

- Archive & Guardrails
  - Duplicates: `src/_archived/duplicates/*`
  - Info: `src/_archived/info-pages/HowItWorksPage.jsx`
  - ESLint: `eslint.config.js`
  - Guards: `scripts/check-no-archived-imports.mjs`, `scripts/find-unreferenced.mjs`

## What to Verify (Smoke)

1) Dashboard: “Explore Sample Project” creates and launches a blueprint.
2) Samples: Filters work; Preview shows details; Copy creates a project that appears on Dashboard.
3) Chat: Process overview panel and journey affordances still render; completion shows “Give Feedback”.
4) Feedback: Submitting writes to Firestore (or localStorage if offline).
5) How It Works: `/how-it-works` renders; optional diagram displayed if `public/images/alf-diagram.svg` exists.

## Recommended Next Steps

- CI: Add `npm run guard:archived` to your CI pipeline (prebuild or lint step) to prevent re-introducing archived code into active imports.
- Optional: Add a preview “Export to PDF” in the drawer for a quick read-only export (hook into your existing PDF services) if desired.
- Incremental lint refactor (safe): remove obvious unused type imports/icons in a few hot spots to reduce noise.

## Notes

- All archive moves are non-destructive and reversible. Active imports from archived paths are blocked by guardrails.
- Expanded samples maintain the same blueprint shape and work offline (localStorage) and online (Firestore) via existing hooks.
