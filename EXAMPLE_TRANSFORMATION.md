### ANALYSIS: What's Wrong?

**CRITERION 1: Learning Objectives (Score: 1/4)**
- outcomes.core are deliverables only, no learning verbs
- No evidence of higher-order thinking
- Success criteria are compliance-based

**CRITERION 2: Assignment Depth (Score: 1/4)**
- Vague student directions: "Look up," "Write down," "Make it look nice"
- No aiOptional anywhere
- Success criteria not student-voiced
- Teacher setup too generic
- No safety guidance despite outdoor/hands-on work

**CRITERION 3: Run of Show (Score: 2/4)**
- Teacher/student bullets all generic: "Help students," "Work on designs"
- Only 0% of weeks have checkpoints (0/4 weeks)
- Deliverables vague: "Notes," "Research notes"
- Week 3-5 is a 3-week black hole with no detail

**CRITERION 4: Assessment (Score: 1/4)**
- No microRubric
- No checkpoints anywhere
- Success criteria are about compliance, not learning

**CRITERION 5: Materials (Score: 1/4)**
- coreKit too vague: "Paper," "Computers"
- noTechFallback completely empty
- safetyEthics empty despite outdoor work

**CRITERION 6: Audience (Score: 2/4)**
- Audiences too vague: "Principal," "Teachers"
- No community connection despite "community garden" title

**OVERALL SCORE: 1.3/4.0 (Needs intensive enrichment - Batch A)**

  ],

  fullOverview:
    'Learners become ecological designers tackling intersecting challenges: food justice, urban heat islands, and climate adaptation. After studying permaculture principles and interviewing community members about barriers to fresh food access, students conduct soil tests, analyze microclimates, and research climate-resilient native plants. Working with local garden coalition partners, they prototype garden designs that balance ecological health, community needs, and maintenance realities. Final design charrettes engage neighbors as co-designers, ensuring gardens reflect cultural foodways and shared stewardship.',

### Key Transformations by Field

#### 1. HERO
**Before:** Generic title and tagline with no student agency
**After:**
- Title specifies focus: "Climate-Adaptive" signals rigor
- Tagline uses active student role: "Students design gardens that..."
- Subjects expanded from 3 to 5, showing interdisciplinary depth

#### 2. MICROOVERVIEW
**Before:** Generic 3 sentences that could describe any garden project
**After:**
- Follows Investigation → Creation → Communication arc
- Specific verbs: investigate, interview, test, design, present
- Names actual methods: soil testing, native plants, community feedback
- Identifies authentic audience: "coalition partners who implement"

#### 3. FULLOVERVIEW (Added)
**Before:** Completely missing
**After:**
- Names student role: "ecological designers"
- References pedagogical approach: co-design, permaculture principles
- Connects to larger issues: food justice, climate adaptation
- Hints at cultural dimension: "cultural foodways and shared stewardship"

#### 4. RUNOFSHOW
**Before:** 4 generic weeks with vague bullets, 0% checkpoints
**After:**
- 7 detailed weeks with clear phase progression
- Teacher bullets use specific verbs: Launch, Model, Facilitate, Coordinate, Coach
- Student bullets are all observable: Analyze, Conduct, Map, Calculate, Present
- 100% of weeks (7/7) have checkpoints
- Deliverables are concrete portfolio artifacts
- All assignments linked to specific weeks

**Example transformation - Week 1 teacher bullets:**

BEFORE:
```typescript
teacher: [
  'Introduce the project',
  'Show videos about gardens',
  'Help students get started'
]
```

AFTER:
```typescript
teacher: [
  'Launch food desert mapping activity using census data',
  'Model soil testing protocol at demo garden site',
  'Facilitate community storyteller panel on food traditions',
  'Introduce permaculture design framework with examples',
  'Establish safety norms for outdoor fieldwork'
]
```

#### 5. OUTCOMES
**Before:** Deliverable-focused, no learning verbs
**After:**
- Core outcomes use Bloom's Analyze/Design/Communicate
- Evidence of DOK 3-4: "using multi-source evidence," "integrate principles and cultural foodways"
- Extras are meaningful extensions, not just "more work"
- Audiences specific enough to invite: "City sustainability office," "Community garden coalition"

#### 6. MATERIALSPREP
**Before:** Vague 3-item list, empty fallbacks, missing safety
**After:**
- coreKit: 8 specific items with models/types
- noTechFallback: 3 viable alternatives enabling full project participation
- safetyEthics: 4 items covering sun safety, consent, property respect, tool use

#### 7. ASSIGNMENTS (Dramatic transformation)

**BEFORE A1:**
```typescript
studentDirections: [
  'Look up different plants',
  'Find out what they need',
  'Write down information'
]
successCriteria: [
  'Complete research',
  'Turn it in on time',
  'Good effort'
]
// No aiOptional, no checkpoint, no safety
```

**AFTER A1:**
```typescript
studentDirections: [
  'Analyze census food access data using provided GIS map layers',
  'Conduct soil pH and texture tests following lab protocol',
  'Interview one community member about food growing traditions',
  'Photograph site from four cardinal directions with labels',
  'Write three-sentence food justice commitment for your team',
  'Upload all evidence to shared project folder by Friday'
]
successCriteria: [
  'I identify patterns in food access using data',
  'I conduct soil tests following protocol accurately',
  'I capture community voices respectfully',
  'I connect food access to justice and climate'
]
checkpoint: 'Teacher reviews site documentation for completeness before Week 2 fieldwork'
aiOptional: {
  toolUse: 'Summarize food access research articles in student language',
  critique: 'Check summary includes voices of affected communities',
  noAIAlt: 'Use jigsaw reading protocol with peers to share articles'
}
safety: [
  'Follow heat safety protocol during outdoor site visits',
  'Wear gloves when handling soil samples'
]
```

**Changes:**
- Directions: 3 vague bullets → 6 specific, actionable tasks
- Each direction names tool/method: "using GIS map layers," "following lab protocol"
- Success criteria: compliance → student-voiced skills
- Added checkpoint creating formative feedback moment
- Added aiOptional with thoughtful integration
- Added safety for hands-on work

#### 8. POLISH (Added completely)
**Before:** Entirely missing
**After:**
- 4-criterion microRubric spanning design quality, evidence use, communication, impact
- 5 checkpoints aligned to WeekCard rhythm
- 4 tags for searchability

#### 9. PLANNINGNOTES (Added)
**Before:** Missing
**After:** Comprehensive paragraph covering:
- Partnership lead time (3-4 weeks)
- Permissions needed (guardian consent, district policies)
- Differentiation strategies (ELL support, advanced extensions, accessibility)
- Logistical tips (evening charrette timing, planting day coordination)

- Named specific community partners: garden coalition
- Integrated multiple disciplines authentically
- Included cultural dimension: foodways, multilingual families

### 3. Made It Teacher-Ready
- Every assignment could be handed to students as-is
- Teacher setup lists specific prep tasks with timelines
- Materials list enables budgeting and ordering
- PlanningNotes anticipates logistics and differentiation
- Checkpoints create assessment rhythm

### 4. Made It Student-Centered

## Time Investment

**Before version:** Could be written in 2-3 hours (but unusable by teachers)

**After version:** Required ~8 hours of enrichment work:
- 1 hour: Outcomes, overview, hero rewrite
- 2 hours: RunOfShow enrichment (7 weeks)
- 4 hours: Assignment expansion (5 assignments × 45 min each)
- 1 hour: Polish, planning notes, materials, QA

**ROI:** 8 hours of enrichment work = project that 30+ teachers can implement successfully over 5+ years = 150+ successful student cohorts

---

## Lessons for Systematic Enrichment

1. **Start with outcomes and microRubric** - these drive everything else
2. **Eliminate ALL vague verbs** - use Verb Upgrade Chart religiously
3. **Add checkpoints liberally** - formative assessment prevents disaster
4. **Write assignments for students, not teachers** - they're student handouts
5. **Use templates** - don't reinvent structure each time
6. **Include safety whenever hands-on** - outdoor, fabrication, food, chemicals
7. **Never leave noTechFallback empty** - equity non-negotiable
8. **Add aiOptional to 50%+ assignments** - helps teachers navigate AI integration
9. **Make planningNotes comprehensive** - anticipate logistics, differentiation, partnerships
10. **Test usability** - could a new teacher implement tomorrow?
