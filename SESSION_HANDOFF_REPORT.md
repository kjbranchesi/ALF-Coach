# ALF Coach - Session Handoff Report
*Date: 2025-08-10*
*Current Session Summary for Next Developer*

## üéØ Executive Summary

ALF Coach is a project-based learning (PBL) blueprint creation tool for teachers. It uses a conversational AI interface to guide teachers through creating comprehensive curriculum packages. The app has three main stages: **Ideation**, **Learning Journey**, and **Deliverables**. 

**Current Status**: Core functionality works but Learning Journey and Deliverables stages need refinement and bug fixes.

## üìö CRITICAL FILES TO REVIEW FIRST

### Documentation Files (Read These First!)
1. **`TEACHER_TESTING_FLOW.md`** - The ideal teacher flow and experience
2. **`TESTING_CHECKLIST.md`** - Technical testing requirements  
3. **`COMPREHENSIVE_TEACHER_FLOW_GUIDE.md`** - Detailed personas and user journeys
4. **`COMPREHENSIVE_TESTING_PROTOCOL.md`** - Complete testing protocol
5. **`README.md`** - Project overview and setup

### Core Application Files
```
/src/components/chat/ChatInterface.tsx    # Main chat interface (1646 lines)
/src/core/SOPFlowManager.ts              # Flow state management
/src/features/chat/ChatLoader.tsx        # Blueprint initialization
/src/hooks/useBlueprintDoc.ts           # Data persistence hook
/src/components/chat/ProgressSidebar.tsx # Shows captured data
```

### Stage Components (NEED WORK)
```
/src/components/chat/stages/             # All stage components
  - JourneyPhaseSelector.tsx            # Learning phases UI
  - ActivityBuilder.tsx                 # Activities accumulator
  - ResourceSelector.tsx                # Resource selection
  - MilestoneSelector.tsx              # Deliverables milestones
  - RubricBuilder.tsx                  # Assessment rubric
  - ImpactDesigner.tsx                 # Audience & sharing
```

## üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX

### Learning Journey Stage Issues
1. **Phase Selector**: Drag-and-drop reordering doesn't work properly
2. **Activity Builder**: Activities don't accumulate correctly across phases
3. **Resource Selector**: Selected resources don't save to blueprint
4. **Data Persistence**: Journey data structure misalignment with UI

### Deliverables Stage Issues  
1. **Milestone Timeline**: Can't adjust dates or reorder milestones
2. **Rubric Builder**: Criteria weights don't update correctly
3. **Impact Designer**: Audience/method selection doesn't persist
4. **Export Functions**: PDFs generate but formatting is broken

### General Issues
- **Console Logging**: Added but needs to be more actionable
- **Progress Sidebar**: Shows data but doesn't update reliably
- **Save & Exit**: Works but sometimes loses stage position
- **Input Position**: Fixed at bottom but sometimes jumps

## üèóÔ∏è APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE

### Flow Structure
```
1. Landing Page ‚Üí 
2. Dashboard (shows saved blueprints) ‚Üí
3. ALF Process Overview (skippable) ‚Üí
4. 4-Step Wizard (Vision, Subject, Context, Resources) ‚Üí
5. Chat Interface with 3 Stages:
   - IDEATION (Big Idea ‚Üí Essential Question ‚Üí Challenge)
   - JOURNEY (Phases ‚Üí Activities ‚Üí Resources)
   - DELIVERABLES (Milestones ‚Üí Rubric ‚Üí Impact)
6. Completion ‚Üí Export Options
```

### Data Flow
```
User Input ‚Üí ChatInterface ‚Üí SOPFlowManager ‚Üí Blueprint State
                    ‚Üì                              ‚Üì
              GeminiService                 useBlueprintDoc
                    ‚Üì                              ‚Üì
              AI Response                  localStorage/Firebase
```

### State Management
- **SOPFlowManager**: Single source of truth for flow state
- **BlueprintDoc**: Data structure for curriculum content
- **ChatInterface**: UI orchestration and user interaction
- **useBlueprintDoc**: Persistence to localStorage and Firebase

## üéØ IDEAL TEACHER EXPERIENCE

### Stage 2: Learning Journey (NEEDS MOST WORK)
Teachers should be able to:
1. **Select 3-5 learning phases** (e.g., Research ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Share)
2. **Drag to reorder phases** visually
3. **Add multiple activities per phase** with accumulator interface
4. **Tag activities** as individual/group/field
5. **Select resources** by type (digital/physical/human/location)
6. **See everything captured** in the progress sidebar

### Stage 3: Deliverables (ALSO NEEDS WORK)
Teachers should be able to:
1. **Set 4-6 milestone checkpoints** on a timeline
2. **Drag milestones** to adjust timing
3. **Build custom rubrics** with weighted criteria
4. **Select authentic audiences** (parents, community, experts)
5. **Choose sharing methods** (presentation, exhibition, publication)
6. **Preview final blueprint** before export

## üíª TECHNICAL CONTEXT

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19.1.0 + TypeScript
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion
- **AI**: Google Gemini API
- **Backend**: Firebase Firestore
- **Build**: Vite
- **State**: Custom SOPFlowManager

### Key Design Patterns
- **Stage Components**: Self-contained UI for each step
- **AI Assistance**: "Ideas", "What If?", "Help" buttons
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show complexity gradually
- **Auto-save**: Every change persists immediately
- **Offline-first**: localStorage with Firebase sync

## üìã DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES

### Priority 1: Fix Learning Journey
1. Fix drag-and-drop for phase reordering
2. Implement proper activity accumulator
3. Ensure resources save correctly
4. Test data persistence thoroughly

### Priority 2: Fix Deliverables  
1. Enable milestone timeline manipulation
2. Fix rubric weight calculations
3. Persist impact selections
4. Improve PDF export formatting

### Priority 3: Polish
1. Ensure progress sidebar always shows current data
2. Add loading states for all async operations
3. Improve error messages and recovery
4. Test save/resume extensively

---

## üß™ TESTING APPROACH

### Quick Validation Test
Create a "Solar System" project:
1. Elementary, Science, 3 weeks
2. Big Idea: "Earth's place in space"
3. Phases: Explore ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Build
4. Add 2 activities per phase
5. Save & Exit after Journey
6. Resume and complete Deliverables
7. Export PDF

This should take 5 minutes and reveal most issues.

## üìù CONSOLE DEBUGGING

### What to Look For
```javascript
[SOPFlowManager] State updated: {currentStage: 'JOURNEY', ...}
[SOPFlowManager] Updating step data: JOURNEY_PHASES
[ChatInterface] User input submitted: ...
[ProgressSidebar] Received props: {capturedData: ...}
[ChatLoader] Saving blueprint to localStorage: ...
```

### Key Debug Commands
```javascript
// In browser console:
localStorage.getItem('blueprint_[ID]')  // Check saved data
flowManager.getState()                  // Current flow state
flowManager.exportBlueprint()           // Full blueprint data
```

---

## üöÄ GETTING STARTED (NEXT SESSION)

1. **Read all .md files** in project root for context
2. **Run the app** and do the 5-minute test
3. **Open console** and observe logging patterns
4. **Focus on Journey/Deliverables** stage components
5. **Test save/resume** extensively
6. **Review stage component code** for state management issues

### Setup Commands
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:5173
# Open DevTools Console (F12)
```

---

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

The app is successful when teachers can:
1. Complete a full blueprint in 20-30 minutes
2. Save and resume at any point without data loss
3. Drag-and-drop to reorder phases and milestones
4. Export a professional PDF ready for classroom use
5. Feel guided but not constrained by the AI

---

## üìå IMPORTANT NOTES

- **User is the client** - Direct communication, no interpretation needed
- **Prioritize Learning Journey and Deliverables** - Ideation mostly works
- **Test as different teacher personas** - See TEACHER_TESTING_FLOW.md
- **Console logging is extensive** - Use it for debugging
- **Save functionality is fragile** - Test thoroughly

---

## ü§ù HANDOFF MESSAGE

**To the next developer**: This is a React/TypeScript educational app that helps teachers create project-based learning blueprints. The core flow works but the Learning Journey and Deliverables stages have significant UX issues. Focus on making the drag-and-drop interfaces work, ensuring data persists correctly, and polishing the teacher experience. All the context you need is in the .md files. The user wants a working app that teachers will love to use. Good luck!
