# Project Showcase Enrichment: Executive Summary

**Created:** October 5, 2025
**Purpose:** Systematic quality improvement for 30 PBL project showcases
**Target:** Address teacher feedback about insufficient detail in assignments, learning objectives, and deliverables

---

## The Challenge

Teachers report that ProjectShowcaseV2 projects lack sufficient detail regarding:
- **Actual assignments and activities** - What do students DO each day?
- **Learning objectives** - What will students actually LEARN?
- **Deliverables** - What concrete artifacts should teachers collect?
- **Assessment** - How do teachers know students are learning?

---

## The Solution

**Key Finding:** The ProjectShowcaseV2 TypeScript schema is pedagogically robust and comprehensive. Quality gaps stem from incomplete field utilization, not schema limitations.

**Approach:** Systematic enrichment of all 30 projects using existing schema fields, guided by curriculum design best practices and evidence from high-quality exemplar projects.

## The Quality Rubric (6 Criteria)

**Each project scored 1-4 on:**

1. **Learning Objectives Clarity (20%)** - Are outcomes learning-focused? Do they use higher-order thinking verbs?
2. **Assignment Depth & Actionability (25%)** - Can students use assignments as self-directed handouts?
3. **Run of Show Scaffolding (20%)** - Are weekly plans specific enough for teachers to implement?
4. **Assessment Architecture (20%)** - Do checkpoints + microRubric create clear evaluation pathway?
5. **Materials & Logistics (10%)** - Can teachers budget and prepare immediately?
6. **Authentic Context & Audience (5%)** - Is there genuine community connection?

**Target:** All 30 projects score 3.0+ (Proficient or better) before publication.

---

## Critical Enrichment Priorities

### The "Must-Fix" List for Every Project

**If a project is missing ANY of these, it's not ready:**

1. **outcomes.core uses learning verbs** (Analyze, Design, Evaluate) not deliverable descriptions ("Create a poster")
2. **ALL assignments have 5-7 specific studentDirections** with concrete verbs and tool references
3. **ALL successCriteria in student voice** ("I can justify..." not "Demonstrates understanding")
4. **microRubric exists with 4+ criteria** spanning content, process, communication, impact
5. **noTechFallback is never empty** - equity non-negotiable
6. **safetyEthics included if hands-on work** (fieldwork, fabrication, food, chemicals, human subjects)
7. **40%+ of WeekCards have checkpoints** creating formative assessment rhythm
8. **ALL assignment IDs referenced in WeekCards exist** in assignments array

---

## Common Quality Gaps Identified

### SYMPTOM → ROOT CAUSE → FIX

**SYMPTOM:** "Students don't know what to do"
**ROOT CAUSE:** Vague studentDirections using weak verbs ("Work on," "Research," "Explore")
**FIX:** Rewrite with specific verbs + tools ("Analyze census data using GIS layers," "Test soil pH following lab protocol")

**SYMPTOM:** "Teachers don't know what students will learn"
**ROOT CAUSE:** outcomes.core describes deliverables, not learning
**FIX:** Rewrite using Bloom's verbs at DOK 3-4 level ("Analyze systems using multi-source evidence to identify leverage points")

**SYMPTOM:** "Assessment feels arbitrary"
**ROOT CAUSE:** No microRubric, no checkpoints, success criteria are compliance-based
**FIX:** Add 4-criterion microRubric, insert checkpoints at 60% of weeks, convert successCriteria to student voice

**SYMPTOM:** "Project fails without technology"
**ROOT CAUSE:** noTechFallback empty or minimal
**FIX:** Add 3 viable low-tech alternatives that enable full learning ("Paper tally sheets," "Hand-drawn maps," "Poster board displays")

**SYMPTOM:** "Assignments feel disconnected from weekly work"
**ROOT CAUSE:** WeekCard.assignments field not used, deliverables don't match evidence
**FIX:** Link assignment IDs to weeks, align deliverables ↔ evidence terminology exactly

---

## Implementation Timeline (4-6 Weeks)

### Week 1: Audit & Prioritize
- Score all 30 projects using Quality Rubric
- Identify exemplars (bio-symphony-skylines, urban-heat, assistive-tech)
- Create 3 batches: A (Intensive, 5 projects), B (Moderate, 15 projects), C (Polish, 10 projects)

### Week 2: Build Templates
- Extract exemplar language from strong projects
- Create reusable templates for assignments, WeekCards, microRubrics
- Compile verb lists and phrase banks

### Weeks 3-4: Systematic Enrichment (Batches A & B)
**Per-project cycle (1 week = 5 projects):**
- Monday: Foundations (Hero → Outcomes)
- Tuesday: Run of Show (WeekCards)
- Wednesday: Assignments Part 1 (Directions + Success Criteria)
- Thursday: Assignments Part 2 (AI + Teacher Setup + Safety)
- Friday: Assessment & Polish (MicroRubric + PlanningNotes + QA)

### Week 5: Polish Batch C & QA
- Quick pass on already-strong projects for missing optional fields
- Cross-check all alignment (deliverables ↔ evidence, assignments ↔ weeks)
- Run Ready-for-Teachers Checklist on all 30

### Week 6: Validation
- Teacher review panel (2-3 educators)
- Spot-check 20% of projects for quality
- Final QA gates before publication

## Key Pedagogical Frameworks Applied

### 1. Backward Design (Wiggins & McTighe)
- Start with learning outcomes, design assessments, then plan activities
- Ensures tight alignment throughout project

### 2. Bloom's Taxonomy (Revised)
- Use higher-order verbs for outcomes: Analyze, Evaluate, Create
- Target DOK 3-4 cognitive demand for PBL projects

### 3. Universal Design for Learning (UDL)
- Multiple means of representation (noTechFallback)
- Multiple means of action/expression (aiOptional alternatives)
- Multiple means of engagement (student choice in assignments)

### 4. Formative Assessment (Black & Wiliam)
- Checkpoint rhythm creates feedback loops before summative assessment
- Student-voice successCriteria enable self-assessment

### 5. Culturally Responsive Pedagogy
- Community partnerships center stakeholder voices
- Cultural elements integrated (foodways, multilingual support)
- Assets-based framing (community expertise valued)

- Checkpoints create clear assessment rhythm

**Study for:** AI integration, safety protocols, student-voice criteria

### 2. urban-heat.showcase.ts
**Strengths:**
- Strong equity framing (heat justice, vulnerable populations)
- Detailed teacher facilitation moves (not generic "help students")
- Evidence-based decision making threaded throughout
- Community partnership integration in every phase

**Study for:** Justice-oriented framing, teacher scaffolds, community engagement

### 3. assistive-tech.showcase.ts

---

## Warning Signs: When a Project Needs Intensive Work

**Red flags indicating Batch A (intensive enrichment):**
- outcomes.core only lists deliverables, no learning verbs
- 50%+ of studentDirections use vague verbs
- No microRubric present
- <20% of weeks have checkpoints
- noTechFallback empty
- No aiOptional in any assignment
- safetyEthics missing despite hands-on work
- successCriteria are compliance-focused ("turned in on time")
- planningNotes absent
- Could not hand assignments to students as-is

**If 5+ red flags present → needs 6-8 hours of enrichment work**

---

## Quick Wins: High-Impact, Low-Effort Improvements

**If you have only 2 hours to improve a project:**

**Hour 1: Assessment Infrastructure (30 min each)**
1. Write 4-criterion microRubric using dimension framework
2. Add checkpoints to 3-4 strategic weeks

**Hour 2: Student Clarity (30 min each)**
1. Convert ALL successCriteria to student voice ("I can...")
2. Fix vague verbs in top 2 assignments' studentDirections

**Result:** Project moves from 2.0 → 2.7 average score with minimal investment

---

## Team Roles for Systematic Enrichment

**Recommended 3-person team structure:**

### Role 1: Content Specialist
- Focus: Outcomes, microRubric, learning objectives alignment
- Ensures cognitive demand and standards alignment
- Reviews successCriteria for skill focus

### Role 2: Assignment Developer
- Focus: studentDirections, teacherSetup, evidence, aiOptional
- Ensures assignments are student-ready handouts
- Adds safety and checkpoint fields

### Role 3: Implementation Specialist
- Focus: WeekCards, materialsPrep, planningNotes
- Ensures teacher logistics clarity
- Coordinates with community partners for authenticity

**Workflow:**
- Role 1 enriches foundations → passes to Role 2 for assignments → passes to Role 3 for implementation → QA review together

---

## When to Ask for Help

**Stuck on:**
- **Outcomes rewriting?** → Use Bloom's verb templates in Quick Reference, study exemplar projects
- **Student directions vague?** → Use Verb Upgrade Chart, ask "What tool/template do they use?"
- **Success criteria sound same?** → Use 4-category framework (Knowledge, Skills, Analysis, Communication)
- **Don't know what checkpoints to add?** → Default to: Week 1-2 (conceptual), mid-project (quality), pre-showcase (rehearsal)
- **AI integration unclear?** → Use templates from Quick Reference (summarize, visualize, draft outline)
- **Overwhelmed?** → Use 10-Minute Rescue Protocol in Quick Reference

**Calibration strategy:**
- Every 3 projects, share work with team for peer review
- Use Quality Rubric for objective scoring
- Reference exemplar projects for comparison

---

## Post-Enrichment: Supporting Teacher Implementation

**After enrichment complete, consider creating:**

### 1. Teacher Implementation Guides (Optional, 1-page per project)
- Week-at-a-glance calendar
- Materials shopping list with supplier links
- Partnership outreach email templates
- Grading rubric expansion (convert microRubric to point-based)

### 2. Student Assignment Handouts (Already done!)
- Each AssignmentCard is already formatted as student handout
- Teachers can copy studentDirections + successCriteria verbatim

### 3. Professional Development Resources
- Video walkthrough of 1 exemplar project
- Teacher FAQ addressing common setup questions
- Differentiation strategy guide by learning need

### 4. Community Partnership Templates
- Generic outreach email for community partners
- Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) template
- Parent/guardian communication letter

---

## Measuring Success: What Changes After Enrichment?

### Teacher Experience Shifts

**BEFORE Enrichment:**
- "I don't understand what students are supposed to learn"
- "The assignments are too vague to implement"
- "I don't know when or how to assess progress"
- "Materials list doesn't tell me what to actually buy"
- "No guidance for students at different levels"

**AFTER Enrichment:**
- "Learning objectives are clear and aligned to my standards"
- "I can hand assignments directly to students as work guides"
- "Checkpoints tell me exactly when to give feedback"
- "I can budget and order materials immediately"
- "PlanningNotes give me differentiation strategies"

### Student Experience Shifts

**BEFORE:**
- Unclear expectations, waiting for teacher clarification
- Compliance-focused ("Did I turn it in?")
- Tech-dependent with no fallback
- Unaware of learning goals

**AFTER:**
- Self-directed using assignment handouts
- Learning-focused ("Can I justify my choices?")
- Multiple pathways (AI optional, tech alternatives)
- Can self-assess using success criteria

### Assessment Shifts

**BEFORE:**
- Summative only (final presentation graded)
- Unclear criteria
- Late-stage failures (students arrive at Week 6 unprepared)

**AFTER:**
- Formative rhythm (checkpoints at Weeks 1, 3, 5)
- Transparent rubric (microRubric + successCriteria)
- Early intervention (checkpoints catch issues before they compound)

---

## Sustainability: Keeping Projects High-Quality

**After initial enrichment, maintain quality through:**

### 1. Annual Review Cycle
- Each summer, review 10 projects for currency (Are community partners still active? Have standards changed?)
- Update materials lists as technology evolves
- Refresh aiOptional guidance as AI tools improve

### 2. Teacher Feedback Loop
- Collect implementation feedback each semester
- Identify common sticking points → update planningNotes
- Share teacher innovations (new partnerships, differentiation strategies)

### 3. Student Work Portfolio
- Collect exemplar student artifacts for each project
- Use in fullOverview or teacher guides as concrete examples
- Show evidence of learning to validate outcomes

### 4. New Project Template
- When creating new projects, start with enrichment standards built in
- Use templates from Quick Reference
- Score with Quality Rubric before publication

---

## Return on Investment
