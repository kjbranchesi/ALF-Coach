## Integration with Existing ALF Coach Stages

### Big Idea Stage Integration

```typescript
// In existing BigIdeaStage component
import { ExitTicket, SelfReflection } from '../components/assessment';
import { FormativeAssessmentIntegrationService } from '../services/FormativeAssessmentIntegrationService';

const assessmentService = new FormativeAssessmentIntegrationService();

// Trigger at stage completion
const handleStageComplete = async () => {
  const triggers = assessmentService.shouldTriggerAssessment(
    project, 
    PBLStage.BIG_IDEA, 
    'stage_completion'
  );
  
  if (triggers.length > 0) {
    // Show appropriate assessments
    const exitTicket = assessmentService.generateExitTicket(PBLStage.BIG_IDEA, project);
    setShowExitTicket(true);
  }
};
```

### Essential Question Stage Integration

```typescript
// Quick formative checks during question development
const handleQuestionDevelopment = () => {
  const quickCheck = assessmentService.generateQuickCheck(
    PBLStage.ESSENTIAL_QUESTION,
    'think_pair_share',
    'How does your Essential Question connect to real-world issues?'
  );
  setShowQuickCheck(true);
};
```

### Journey Stage Integration

```typescript
// Peer assessment during collaborative phases
const handleCollaborativeActivity = () => {
  const peerAssessment = assessmentService.generatePeerAssessment(
    PBLStage.JOURNEY,
    currentUserId,
    partnerId,
    partnerName
  );
  setShowPeerAssessment(true);
};
```

### Deliverables Stage Integration

```typescript
// Multiple assessment types for final products
const handleDeliverablesStage = async () => {
  // Self-reflection on learning journey
  const reflection = assessmentService.generateSelfReflection(PBLStage.DELIVERABLES, project);
  
  // Peer feedback on products
  const peerAssessment = assessmentService.generatePeerAssessment(
    PBLStage.DELIVERABLES,
    currentUserId,
    reviewTargetId,
    reviewTargetName
  );
};
```

## Data Flow Architecture

### 1. Assessment Data Creation
```typescript
// When student completes assessment
const handleAssessmentComplete = async (responses) => {
  const collection = await assessmentService.loadAssessmentData(projectId);
  
  // Add new assessment data
  collection.exitTickets.push(completedExitTicket);
  
  // Save updated collection
  await assessmentService.saveAssessmentData(projectId, collection);
  
  // Update progress dashboard
  await updateProgressDashboard();
};
```

### 2. Real-time Analytics Processing
```typescript
// Generate insights from assessment data
const generateInsights = async () => {
  const insights = await assessmentService.analyzeAssessmentData(
    projectId, 
    studentIds
  );
  
  // Update teacher dashboard
  const dashboard = await assessmentService.generateProgressDashboard(
    projectId,
    classId,
    currentStage,
    studentIds
  );
  
  return { insights, dashboard };
};
```

### 3. Intervention Triggers
```typescript
// Automatic intervention suggestions
const checkInterventions = async (insights) => {
  const suggestions = assessmentService.generateInterventionSuggestions(
    insights,
    currentStage
  );
  
  // Notify teacher of high-priority suggestions
  suggestions
    .filter(s => s.priority === 'high')
    .forEach(suggestion => {
      showNotification(suggestion);
    });
};
```

```

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Assessment data is lazy-loaded to avoid impacting core PBL performance
- Dashboard uses pagination for large classes
- Real-time updates use WebSocket connections where available

### Scalability  
- Assessment data storage is partitioned by project and time period
- Analytics processing uses background job queues
- Dashboard queries are optimized with proper indexing

### Accessibility
- All assessment components support screen readers
- Keyboard navigation is fully implemented
- High contrast mode is supported
- Text scaling works correctly

### Security
- Assessment responses are encrypted at rest
- API endpoints use proper authentication
- Student data access is logged and audited
- Data retention policies are enforced

This comprehensive formative assessment system transforms ALF Coach from a project creation tool into a complete learning management platform that supports continuous improvement and data-driven instruction throughout the PBL journey.
