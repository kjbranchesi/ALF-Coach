## 5. DATA CAPTURE VS. SUMMARIZATION STRATEGY

### Performance Optimization Principles

The ALF Coach application must balance comprehensive data capture with optimal performance. This section outlines what data should be captured in full detail versus what should be summarized for efficient processing.

### Full Data Capture Requirements

**Core Blueprint Data (Always Capture Fully):**
```typescript
// Critical data that must be preserved completely
interface CoreDataCapture {
  // Wizard - Complete capture for personalization
  wizard: WizardData;
  
  // Ideation - Core curriculum elements
  ideation: {
    bigIdea: string;           // Full text needed for coherence
    essentialQuestion: string;  // Complete question for validity
    challenge: string;         // Full challenge for implementation
  };
  
  // Journey - Complete structure for implementation
  journey: {
    phases: JourneyPhase[];    // Full phase data for timeline
    activities: string[];      // Complete activity descriptions
    resources: string[];       // Full resource lists for planning
  };
  
  // Deliverables - Assessment requirements
  deliverables: {
    milestones: Milestone[];   // Complete milestone data
    rubric: RubricCriteria[];  // Full rubric for assessment
    impact: ImpactData;        // Complete impact planning
  };
}
```

**User Interaction Data (Capture Selectively):**
```typescript
interface SelectiveInteractionCapture {
  // Chat history - Summarize older conversations
  conversationHistory: {
    recentMessages: ChatMessage[];     // Last 20 messages in full
    conversationSummary: string;       // AI-generated summary of older content
    criticalDecisions: DecisionPoint[]; // Key decision points preserved
  };
  
  // AI suggestions - Keep only accepted ones
  suggestions: {
    accepted: SuggestionCard[];        // Suggestions user incorporated
    // rejected suggestions are not stored
  };
}
```

### Data Summarization Strategy

**Conversation History Management:**
- **Capture Fully:** Last 20 messages in each stage for context
- **Summarize:** Older conversations into key decision points and rationale
- **Archive:** Complete conversation logs for premium accounts or research

**AI Response Optimization:**
```typescript
interface ConversationSummary {
  stageDecisions: {
    stage: SOPStage;
    keyChoices: string[];      // Major decisions made
    iterations: number;        // How many refinements
    timeSpent: number;         // Minutes in stage
  }[];
  
  userPreferences: {
    preferredSuggestionTypes: string[]; // Types of AI help used most
    typicalChoicePatterns: string[];    // Common decision patterns
    complexity: 'simple' | 'detailed'; // User's preferred detail level
  };
  
  contentFocus: {
    dominantThemes: string[];   // Most common content areas
    frequentKeywords: string[]; // Often-used terms
    difficultyAreas: string[];  // Stages that required most help
  };
}
```

**Performance Data (Always Summarize):**
- **Capture:** Basic usage metrics (time per stage, completion rates)
- **Summarize:** Detailed interaction logs into usage patterns
- **Aggregate:** Individual data into anonymized improvement insights

### Memory Management Strategy

**Browser Storage Optimization:**
```typescript
// localStorage strategy
interface LocalStorageOptimization {
  // Always store locally
  coreBlueprint: BlueprintDoc;      // Essential project data
  userPreferences: UserPreferences;  // Settings and customizations
  
  // Conditionally store
  recentConversations: ChatMessage[]; // Clear after 24 hours
  draftResponses: string[];          // Clear on stage completion
  
  // Never store locally
  fullConversationHistory: never;   // Too large for localStorage
  aiModelResponses: never;          // Can be regenerated
}
```

**Cloud Storage Strategy:**
```typescript
// Firestore optimization
interface CloudStorageOptimization {
  // Main document (size limit: 1MB)
  blueprintCore: {
    metadata: BlueprintMetadata;
    wizard: WizardData;
    ideation: IdeationData;
    journey: JourneyData;
    deliverables: DeliverablesData;
  };
  
  // Subcollections for large data
  conversations: {
    // One document per stage
    [stageId]: {
      messages: ChatMessage[];
      summary: ConversationSummary;
    };
  };
  
  analytics: {
    // Usage data for improvements
    sessionData: SessionData[];
    performanceMetrics: PerformanceMetrics;
  };
}
```

  centralizedUpdates: SOPFlowManager;
  
  // No direct component-to-storage updates
  noDirectWrites: never;
  
  // Consistent data structure across all components
  standardizedInterfaces: SOPTypes;
}
```

**2. Optimistic Updates with Rollback**
```typescript
interface OptimisticUpdatePattern {
  // Update UI immediately
  immediateUIUpdate: (data: any) => void;
  
  // Attempt cloud save
  cloudSave: (data: any) => Promise<boolean>;
  
  // Rollback on failure
  rollbackOnFailure: (previousData: any) => void;
  
  // Retry mechanism
  retryStrategy: RetryConfig;
}
```

**3. Data Validation at Every Layer**
```typescript
interface ValidationLayers {
  // Client-side validation
  inputValidation: (input: any) => ValidationResult;
  
  // Business logic validation
  semanticValidation: (data: BlueprintDoc) => ValidationResult;
  
  // Storage validation
  schemaValidation: (document: any) => ValidationResult;
}
```

### Performance Optimization Strategies

**1. Lazy Loading of Non-Critical Data**
```typescript
interface LazyLoadingStrategy {
  // Load immediately
  coreData: BlueprintDoc;
  currentStageData: any;

  conversationHistory: () => Promise<ChatMessage[]>;
  exportFormats: () => Promise<ExportData>;
  templateLibrary: () => Promise<Template[]>;
}
```

**2. Intelligent Caching**
```typescript
interface CachingStrategy {
  // Cache for session duration
  sessionCache: {
    aiSuggestions: Map<string, SuggestionCard[]>;
    validationResults: Map<string, ValidationResult>;
  };
  
  // Cache across sessions
  persistentCache: {
    userPreferences: UserPreferences;
    templateLibrary: Template[];
    frequentlyUsedData: any[];
  };
  
  // Cache invalidation rules
  invalidationTriggers: {
    onDataChange: string[];
    onTimeExpiry: { [key: string]: number };
    onVersionChange: string[];
  };
}
```

**3. Batch Operations**
```typescript
interface BatchOperations {
  // Batch updates to reduce round trips
  batchWrites: (updates: Update[]) => Promise<boolean>;
  
  // Batch reads for related data
  batchReads: (queries: Query[]) => Promise<any[]>;
  
  // Debounced saves for frequent updates
  debouncedSave: (data: any, delay: number) => void;
}
```

### Data Security and Privacy

**1. Data Minimization**
```typescript
interface DataMinimizationPractices {
  // Only collect necessary data
  necessaryDataOnly: (input: any) => FilteredData;
  
  // Anonymize analytics data
  anonymizeAnalytics: (data: any) => AnonymizedData;
  
  // Regular data cleanup
  scheduleDataCleanup: (retentionPeriod: number) => void;
}
```

**2. User Data Ownership**
```typescript
interface UserDataOwnership {
  // Users can export all their data
  exportUserData: (userId: string) => Promise<UserDataExport>;
  
  // Users can delete all their data
  deleteUserData: (userId: string) => Promise<boolean>;
  
  // Users control sharing permissions
  manageSharing: (projectId: string, permissions: SharingPermissions) => void;
}
```

**3. Offline-First Architecture**
```typescript
interface OfflineFirstStrategy {
  // Always work offline
  offlineCapability: {
    localStorage: LocalStorageManager;
    syncOnReconnect: SyncManager;
    conflictResolution: ConflictResolver;
  };
  
  // Graceful degradation
  fallbackModes: {
    noAI: () => StaticSuggestionsProvider;
    noCloud: () => LocalOnlyProvider;
    noInternet: () => OfflineOnlyProvider;
  };
}
```

### Error Handling and Recovery

**1. Graceful Error Recovery**
```typescript
interface ErrorRecoveryStrategy {
  // Automatic recovery attempts
  autoRecovery: {
    networkErrors: RetryStrategy;
    validationErrors: CorrectionStrategy;
    storageErrors: FallbackStrategy;
  };
  
  // User-friendly error messages
  userErrorMessages: {
    translationFunction: (error: Error) => UserMessage;
    recoveryInstructions: (error: Error) => RecoverySteps;
  };
  
  // Data preservation during errors
  dataPreservation: {
    autoSave: AutoSaveStrategy;
    errorStateStorage: ErrorStateManager;
    recoveryOptions: RecoveryOptionsProvider;
  };
}
```

**2. Data Consistency Maintenance**
```typescript
interface DataConsistencyStrategy {
  // Cross-stage validation
  validateConsistency: (blueprint: BlueprintDoc) => ValidationResult;
  
  // Automatic consistency repairs
  repairInconsistencies: (issues: ValidationResult) => RepairResult;
  
  // User notification of consistency issues
  notifyInconsistencies: (issues: ValidationResult) => UserNotification;
}
```
