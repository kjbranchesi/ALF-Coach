# ALF Coach Conversation Flow Process Guide
## A Practical Implementation Framework for Chatbot-Guided Project Design

---

## Executive Summary

This document provides a detailed, testable framework for how the ALF Coach chatbot guides educators through each stage of project-based learning design. It builds on the existing COMPREHENSIVE_ALF_COACH_EDUCATIONAL_FLOW_REPORT.md and focuses specifically on conversation patterns, prompting strategies, and user flow management.

**Current Implementation Status:**
- ChatbotFirstInterfaceFixed.tsx handles stage management and AI integration
- StageSpecificSuggestions.tsx provides contextual suggestion cards
- WizardHandoffService creates initial context from wizard data
- GeminiService manages AI responses and conversation flow

**Key Principles:**
1. **Progressive Disclosure:** Information is revealed as needed, not all at once
2. **Contextual Guidance:** Every prompt and suggestion is informed by previous decisions
3. **Flexible Progression:** Users can move forward or revisit previous stages naturally
4. **Error Recovery:** Multiple pathways to help stuck or confused users
5. **Data Continuity:** All conversation data feeds into the final project blueprint

---

## 1. OVERALL CONVERSATION FRAMEWORK

### Core Conversation Philosophy

The ALF Coach operates as a **supportive colleague**, not a rigid wizard. Conversations should feel natural and collaborative while ensuring all necessary information is captured for project design.

### Stage Progression Model

```typescript
// Current stages in ChatbotFirstInterfaceFixed.tsx
type ProjectStage = 
  | 'ONBOARDING'      // Wizard collection of basic context
  | 'GROUNDING'       // Welcome and context verification
  | 'BIG_IDEA'        // Conceptual foundation development
  | 'ESSENTIAL_QUESTION' // Inquiry framework design
  | 'CHALLENGE'       // Authentic task definition
  | 'JOURNEY'         // Learning phase planning
  | 'DELIVERABLES'    // Assessment and output design
  | 'COMPLETE'        // Export and finalization
```

### Conversation State Management

```typescript
// How conversation state is tracked
interface ConversationState {
  currentStage: ProjectStage;
  messageCountInStage: number;
  wizardContext: WizardData;
  capturedData: {
    bigIdea: string;
    essentialQuestion: string;
    challenge: string;
    // Additional stage data
  };
  userConfusionLevel: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  lastSuggestionType: 'ideas' | 'whatif' | 'help' | null;
}
```

---

## 2. STAGE-BY-STAGE CONVERSATION FLOWS

### Stage 0: Onboarding (Wizard)
**Current Implementation:** StreamlinedWizard component
**Purpose:** Collect essential context before conversation begins

**Data Captured:**
- Project topic and learning goals
- Subject areas and grade level  
- Duration and resources
- Teacher's PBL experience level
- Entry point (learning goal vs. materials-first vs. exploration)

**Handoff to Chat:**
Uses WizardHandoffService.generateHandoff() to create:
- Contextual welcome message
- System prompt with all wizard context
- Suggested next steps based on entry point

### Stage 1: Grounding (Context Verification)
**Goal:** Verify wizard context and establish collaborative relationship

#### Opening Prompts (Generated by WizardHandoffService)

**For Learning Goal Entry:**
```
Great! You want students to explore "[PROJECT_TOPIC]". That's a compelling focus!

For your [GRADE_LEVEL] students over [DURATION], we'll create something meaningful and achievable.

[Subject-specific encouragement based on wizard data]

Let's start by crafting a compelling driving question. This open-ended question will guide your students' entire inquiry. Based on your topic, what essential question should students explore?
```

**For Materials-First Entry:**
```
Starting with materials you already have is smart! Your topic "[PROJECT_TOPIC]" gives us a clear direction.

[Context acknowledgment from wizard]

Since you're building around available resources, what big idea or theme could connect your materials to meaningful student learning?
```

#### Follow-up Question Patterns

**If user asks for clarification:**
- "I'd be happy to explain! Think of this as the lens through which students will see your entire project..."

**If user provides topic but needs refinement:**
- "That's a solid starting point! How might we focus this so students are exploring something they can take action on?"

**If user seems overwhelmed:**
- "Let's break this down. You mentioned [WIZARD_CONTEXT]. What's one thing about [TOPIC] that you think would really grab your students' attention?"

#### Stage Transition Triggers

**Move to BIG_IDEA when:**
- User provides substantive response (>10 characters)
- Response doesn't contain help-seeking language
- messageCountInStage >= 1

#### Data Capture Points

- **Conversation Summary:** Key decisions and user preferences
- **Refinement Notes:** How initial wizard data was modified
- **User Confusion Indicators:** Questions asked, help requested

#### Error Recovery Strategies

**If user says "I don't know":**
```
That's completely normal! Let's think about your students. When they walk into your classroom, what do you want them to be curious about? What real-world issue or fascinating idea could drive their work for [DURATION]?
```

**If user asks for examples:**
```
Absolutely! Here are some examples that work well for [GRADE_LEVEL] [SUBJECT]:
[Generate contextual examples using StageSpecificSuggestions]
```

### Stage 2: Big Idea Development
**Goal:** Develop overarching conceptual theme that anchors the project

#### Opening Prompts

**Standard Opening:**
```python
# Generated by buildSystemPrompt() in GeminiService
You are a helpful colleague helping an educator develop their Big Idea for a project-based learning experience.

[WIZARD_CONTEXT from WizardContextHelper]

The Big Idea is the overarching concept or theme that will drive the entire project. Based on their context, help them think about what matters most to their students.

NEVER ask for information already provided. Instead, build on their context to provide thoughtful guidance.

Respond conversationally as a supportive colleague. Ask ONE clarifying question or make ONE helpful observation.
```

#### Conversation Flow Patterns

**First Exchange:**
- AI asks one focused question about conceptual direction
- User responds with initial idea
- AI provides supportive feedback and gentle refinement

**Example Flow:**
```
AI: "Based on your [SUBJECT] focus, what big concept do you want students to deeply understand? Think beyond facts to ideas that will matter in their lives."

User: "I want them to understand how technology affects communication"

AI: "That's a powerful theme! Technology and communication touches every aspect of students' lives. Are you thinking more about how digital tools change how we connect with others, or how technology can amplify voices that might not otherwise be heard?"
```

#### Suggestion Card Integration

**When to Show Cards:**
- User asks "can you give me some ideas?"
- User responds with "I'm not sure"
- messageCountInStage > 2 without clear direction

**Card Types (from StageSpecificSuggestions):**
- **Idea Cards:** Conceptual themes appropriate for grade/subject
- **What-if Cards:** "What if students explored..."
- **Resource Cards:** Links to examples and frameworks

#### Stage Transition Triggers

**Move to ESSENTIAL_QUESTION when:**
```typescript
// From ChatbotFirstInterfaceFixed.tsx detectStageTransition()
if (projectState.stage === 'BIG_IDEA' && userInput.length > 10) {
  if (!input.includes('?') && !input.includes('help') && !input.includes('example')) {
    // Store bigIdea and transition
    setProjectState(prev => ({
      ...prev,
      ideation: { ...prev.ideation, bigIdea: userInput, bigIdeaConfirmed: true },
      stage: 'ESSENTIAL_QUESTION'
    }));
  }
}
```

#### Data Capture Strategy

**Store Immediately:**
- Raw user input as bigIdea
- Conversation context that led to decision
- Any refinements suggested by AI

**Don't Overthink:**
- User can always refine in later stages
- Capture intent, not perfect wording

#### Error Recovery

**User Provides Question Instead of Concept:**
```
I see you're already thinking about the inquiry students will do! That's great forward thinking. Before we get to that driving question, let's nail down the big concept. Your question suggests students should explore [EXTRACT_CONCEPT]. Is [CONCEPT] the main theme you want them to understand?
```

**User Provides Activity Instead of Concept:**
```
I love that you're thinking about what students will DO! That sounds like an engaging activity. Now, what big idea or concept would that activity help students understand? What's the deeper learning?
```

### Stage 3: Essential Question Formation
**Goal:** Create open-ended inquiry question that drives student investigation

#### Opening Prompts

**With Established Big Idea:**
```python
You are a supportive colleague helping an educator develop their Essential Question.

[WIZARD_CONTEXT]

Their established Big Idea is: "[BIG_IDEA]"

The Essential Question should be open-ended and drive inquiry throughout the project, connecting to their Big Idea.

Respond as a thoughtful colleague. Make ONE helpful observation or ask ONE clarifying question about what kind of inquiry they want to spark.
```

#### Conversation Flow Patterns

**Standard Progression:**
1. **Opening:** AI acknowledges Big Idea and explains Essential Question purpose
2. **Exploration:** AI asks about inquiry type or student perspective
3. **Refinement:** User provides question, AI offers refinement suggestions
4. **Confirmation:** Finalize question that drives sustained inquiry

**Example Flow:**
```
AI: "Perfect! With '[BIG_IDEA]' as your theme, we need a question that will keep students investigating throughout the project. What aspect of [BIG_IDEA] do you want students to grapple with? Should the question focus on problems to solve, perspectives to explore, or impacts to evaluate?"

User: "I want them to figure out if technology helps or hurts relationships"

AI: "Great direction! That gets at the heart of the issue. How might we phrase that as an open question that couldn't be answered with just 'yes' or 'no'? Maybe something like 'How does technology reshape the way we build and maintain relationships?' What feels right to you?"
```

#### Suggestion Card Triggers

**Show Ideas When:**
- User asks "what kinds of questions work well?"
- User provides closed-ended question (yes/no)
- User seems stuck after 2+ exchanges

**Card Content:**
- Question starters: "How might...", "What if...", "Why do..."
- Subject-specific question examples
- Questions that connect to current events

#### What-If Scenario Prompts

**Generated by buildWhatIfActionPrompt():**
```
Generate 4 "what if" scenarios that could transform or extend this Essential Question to make it even more engaging and relevant for students.

Current Essential Question: "[USER_QUESTION]"
Big Idea: "[BIG_IDEA]"
```

#### Stage Transition Logic

**Move to CHALLENGE when:**
```typescript
if (projectState.stage === 'ESSENTIAL_QUESTION' && userInput.length > 10) {
  if (input.includes('?') || userInput.split(' ').length > 5) {
    // Question-like or substantive response
    setProjectState(prev => ({
      ...prev,
      ideation: { ...prev.ideation, essentialQuestion: userInput, essentialQuestionConfirmed: true },
      stage: 'CHALLENGE'
    }));
  }
}
```

#### Data Extraction Strategies

**From Conversation:**
- Look for question marks and question words
- Extract complete question even if embedded in longer response
- Note user's rationale for question choice

**Quality Indicators:**
- Open-ended (not yes/no)
- Connected to Big Idea
- Grade-appropriate complexity
- Sustains inquiry over project duration

### Stage 4: Challenge Design
**Goal:** Define authentic, actionable task that students will complete

#### Opening Prompts

**With Big Idea and Essential Question:**
```python
You are a supportive colleague helping an educator define their Challenge.

[WIZARD_CONTEXT]

Their established Big Idea is: "[BIG_IDEA]"
Their Essential Question is: "[ESSENTIAL_QUESTION]"

The Challenge should be a concrete, authentic task that connects to their Big Idea and Essential Question.

Respond as a helpful colleague. Make ONE thoughtful observation or ask ONE clarifying question about what kind of authentic work they envision for students.
```

#### Conversation Flow Patterns

**Challenge Development Process:**
1. **Connect to EQ:** How does this challenge help answer the Essential Question?
2. **Audience:** Who needs this work? Who will students serve?
3. **Action:** What will students actually create or do?
4. **Authenticity:** How does this mirror real-world work?

**Example Flow:**
```
AI: "With your Essential Question '[ESSENTIAL_QUESTION]', students need a concrete way to explore that inquiry. Who in your community would benefit from students' insights on this topic? Maybe parents, local businesses, or community organizations?"

User: "Parents are always asking about screen time and social media"

AI: "Perfect! Parents would definitely value student insights. So what if students created something to help parents navigate [BIG_IDEA] with their own families? What format would be most useful - a guide, presentation, toolkit, or something else?"
```

#### Suggestion Card Strategy

**Challenge Ideas Generate When:**
- User requests examples: "What are some good challenges?"
- User provides vague response: "Maybe a project?"
- User focuses on academic exercise rather than authentic work

**Card Categories:**
- **Creation Challenges:** Design, build, produce something new
- **Investigation Challenges:** Research and report on real issues  
- **Service Challenges:** Solve problems for real stakeholders
- **Advocacy Challenges:** Raise awareness or drive change

#### Authenticity Validation

**AI Checks For:**
- Real audience (not just teacher)
- Meaningful impact beyond classroom
- Student choice in approach
- Multiple valid solutions possible

**Refinement Prompts:**
```
That's a solid academic exercise! How might we give it more real-world impact? Who outside the classroom would actually benefit from students' work on this?
```

#### Stage Transition Triggers

**Move to JOURNEY when:**
```typescript
if (projectState.stage === 'CHALLENGE' && userInput.length > 10) {
  if (!input.includes('help') && !input.includes('example')) {
    // Substantive challenge response
    setProjectState(prev => ({
      ...prev,
      ideation: { ...prev.ideation, challenge: userInput, challengeConfirmed: true },
      stage: 'JOURNEY'
    }));
  }
}
```

#### Data Capture Focus

**Essential Elements:**
- Challenge description
- Target audience/stakeholders
- Expected student outputs
- Success criteria
- Real-world connections

### Stage 5: Learning Journey Planning
**Goal:** Map student progression through Analyze → Brainstorm → Prototype → Evaluate

#### Opening Prompts

**With Complete Ideation:**
```python
You are a supportive colleague helping an educator plan the learning journey that supports their established project.

[WIZARD_CONTEXT]

Project Context:
Big Idea: "[BIG_IDEA]"
Essential Question: "[ESSENTIAL_QUESTION]"  
Challenge: "[CHALLENGE]"

Help them plan the learning journey (2-3 sentences maximum). Ask ONE clarifying question or make ONE helpful observation about the current step.
```

#### Four-Phase Framework

**Phase 1: Analyze**
- **Purpose:** Students understand the problem/context
- **AI Prompts:** "What do students need to research or investigate before they can tackle your challenge?"
- **Common Activities:** Research, interviews, data collection, problem analysis

**Phase 2: Brainstorm** 
- **Purpose:** Students generate multiple solution ideas
- **AI Prompts:** "How will students generate creative solutions? Individual brainstorming, team ideation, or community input?"
- **Common Activities:** Ideation sessions, mind mapping, solution research

**Phase 3: Prototype**
- **Purpose:** Students develop and test solutions
- **AI Prompts:** "What will students create to test their ideas? Mockups, pilots, detailed plans?"
- **Common Activities:** Design, creation, iteration, peer feedback

**Phase 4: Evaluate**
- **Purpose:** Students assess and present final solutions
- **AI Prompts:** "How will students know if their solution works? Who will provide feedback?"
- **Common Activities:** Testing, presentation, reflection, celebration

#### Conversation Flow Strategy

**Sequential Phase Planning:**
```
AI: "Let's map out the learning journey. Starting with the Analyze phase - what do students need to understand about [CHALLENGE] before they can solve it?"

User: "They need to research current solutions and interview stakeholders"

AI: "Excellent! Research and interviews will give them solid foundation. For the Brainstorm phase, how do you want them to generate solution ideas? Working individually first, then sharing with teams?"
```

**Flexible Adaptation:**
- If user provides all phases at once, work with that
- If user focuses on one phase, guide through others
- Allow non-linear discussion but ensure all phases covered

#### Suggestion Card Integration

**Phase-Specific Ideas:**
- **Analyze:** Research methods, investigation techniques
- **Brainstorm:** Ideation strategies, creativity exercises  
- **Prototype:** Creation tools, testing methods
- **Evaluate:** Assessment strategies, presentation formats

#### Duration and Pacing

**AI Guidance:**
```
Based on your [DURATION] timeline, how long do you think each phase should take? Keep in mind students usually need more time for research and creation than we initially think.
```

**Validation Prompts:**
- Check if phases fit within total duration
- Ensure adequate time for iteration
- Plan for unexpected delays

#### Stage Transition Triggers

**Move to DELIVERABLES when:**
```typescript
if (projectState.stage === 'JOURNEY' && projectState.messageCountInStage >= 2) {
  // After sufficient journey planning
  setProjectState(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    stage: 'DELIVERABLES'
  }));
}
```

#### Data Capture Strategy

**For Each Phase:**
- Duration/timeline
- Key activities
- Resources needed
- Assessment checkpoints

### Stage 6: Deliverables and Assessment Design
**Goal:** Define tangible outputs and evaluation criteria

#### Opening Prompts

**With Journey Established:**
```python
You are a supportive colleague helping an educator create deliverables and assessments that align with their established project.

[WIZARD_CONTEXT + IDEATION_CONTEXT + JOURNEY_CONTEXT]

Help them create deliverables and assessments (2-3 sentences maximum). Ask ONE clarifying question or make ONE helpful observation about the current step.
```

#### Three-Part Framework

**1. Product Definition**
- What students will create
- Format and specifications
- Individual vs. team components

**2. Assessment Criteria**
- Learning objectives alignment
- Process vs. product evaluation
- Rubric development

**3. Authentic Audience**
- Who will receive student work
- Presentation format
- Feedback mechanisms

#### Conversation Flow Patterns

**Product-First Approach:**
```
AI: "Based on your challenge '[CHALLENGE]', what should students create to demonstrate their learning? Think about what would be most valuable to [AUDIENCE]."

User: "Maybe a presentation and written recommendations"

AI: "Great! A presentation allows for personal connection, and written recommendations provide lasting value. How detailed should those recommendations be? A one-page summary or a comprehensive guide?"
```

**Assessment-First Approach:**
```
AI: "What evidence of learning do you need to see? Are you more interested in their research process, creative solutions, or ability to communicate findings?"

User: "I want to see their thinking process and final recommendations"

AI: "Perfect! So we need to capture both journey and destination. What if students maintained a design journal throughout, then presented their final recommendations to [AUDIENCE]?"
```

#### Rubric Development Guidance

**AI Prompting Strategy:**
```
Let's create assessment criteria. What are the 3-4 most important things you want to evaluate? Think about both content mastery and 21st-century skills.
```

**Common Criteria Categories:**
- Content knowledge and research quality
- Creative problem-solving
- Communication and presentation
- Collaboration and process

#### Suggestion Card Content

**Deliverable Ideas:**
- Digital presentations, infographics, videos
- Physical prototypes, models, displays
- Written reports, proposals, guides
- Community presentations, workshops

**Assessment Approaches:**
- Peer evaluation strategies
- Self-reflection protocols
- Stakeholder feedback methods
- Portfolio-based assessment

#### Stage Transition Triggers

**Move to COMPLETE when:**
```typescript
if (projectState.stage === 'DELIVERABLES' && projectState.messageCountInStage >= 2) {
  // After sufficient deliverables planning
  setProjectState(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    stage: 'COMPLETE'
  }));
}
```

#### Data Capture Focus

**Essential Elements:**
- Deliverable specifications
- Assessment rubric criteria
- Presentation audience and format
- Timeline and milestones

## 3. SUGGESTION CARD SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION

### Current Architecture (StageSpecificSuggestions.tsx)

```typescript
interface Suggestion {
  id: string;
  text: string;
  category: 'idea' | 'whatif' | 'resource';
}

// Generated by getStageSpecificSuggestions()
const suggestions = getStageSpecificSuggestions(stage, context);
```

### Contextual Generation Strategy

**Data Flow:**
1. **Wizard Context:** Initial project parameters
2. **Conversation Context:** Current stage progress
3. **User Patterns:** Detected preferences and confusion points
4. **AI Enhancement:** GeminiService generates contextual suggestions

### Stage-Specific Card Strategies

#### Big Idea Stage Cards

**Trigger Conditions:**
- User asks "can you give me some ideas?"
- User responds with "I'm not sure"
- No clear conceptual direction after 2 exchanges

**Card Generation (from GeminiService.buildIdeasActionPrompt()):**
```python
# For Big Ideas
Generate 4 specific Big Ideas - these should be CONCEPTUAL THEMES or OVERARCHING CONCEPTS (like "The intersection of AI and human creativity"), NOT project descriptions or activities.

Current context: [WIZARD_DATA + CONVERSATION_PROGRESS]
```

**Example Cards:**
- "The power of data in decision-making"
- "How design shapes human behavior"  
- "The role of voice in social change"
- "Innovation through constraint"

#### Essential Question Stage Cards

**Contextual Integration:**
```python
# Cards build on established Big Idea
The educator is working on their Essential Question based on their Big Idea: "[BIG_IDEA]"

Generate 4 specific Essential Question suggestions that are open-ended, thought-provoking, and drive inquiry throughout the project.
```

**Example Cards:**
- "How might data tell different stories depending on who analyzes it?"
- "What happens when design prioritizes efficiency over humanity?"
- "In what ways can individual voices create collective change?"

#### Challenge Stage Cards

**Authenticity Focus:**
```python
The educator is defining their Challenge. Essential Question: "[EQ]", Big Idea: "[BIG_IDEA]"

Generate 4 specific suggestions for authentic tasks, problems, or creation opportunities that students will tackle. Make them concrete and achievable within a project timeframe.
```

### What-If Scenario Cards

**Purpose:** Expand thinking without commitment
**Trigger:** User clicks "What if..." button or requests alternatives

**Generation Strategy (GeminiService.buildWhatIfActionPrompt()):**
```python
Generate 4 "what if" scenarios that could enhance or transform their current approach.

Context: [CURRENT_STAGE_PROGRESS]

Example format:
"What if students created an AI ethics policy for your school district?"
"What if students interviewed professionals about how they use AI ethically?"
```

### Card Presentation Timing

**Automatic Display Rules:**
```typescript
// From ChatbotFirstInterfaceFixed.tsx
const shouldShowAutomaticSuggestions = () => {
  return (
    suggestibleStages.includes(projectState.stage) &&
    projectState.stage !== lastSuggestionStage &&
    !input.trim() &&
    projectState.messageCountInStage <= 1
  );
};
```

**Manual Display Rules:**
- User clicks Ideas button
- User types help-seeking language
- User explicitly requests examples

---

## 4. PROMPTING STRATEGIES FOR INFORMATION GATHERING

### Contextual Prompt Building

**System Prompt Architecture (from GeminiService):**
```python
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are an expert curriculum designer helping educators create project-based learning experiences using the Active Learning Framework (ALF).

Current Stage: {stage}
User Context: {context}
{stageInstructions}

Your role is to:
1. Guide teachers through designing projects where STUDENTS journey through the Creative Process
2. Be conversational but professional  
3. Ask one question at a time
4. Provide specific, actionable suggestions
5. Remember: Teachers DESIGN the curriculum, Students DO the creative process
"""
```

### Progressive Information Gathering

**Principle:** Never ask for information already collected
**Implementation:** WizardContextHelper.generateContextualPromptPrefix()

```python
# Always include wizard context
def buildSystemPrompt(step, action, context):
    wizardContext = WizardContextHelper.generateContextualPromptPrefix(context)
    
    if step === 'IDEATION_BIG_IDEA':
        return f"""
        You are helping develop their Big Idea.
        
        {wizardContext}
        
        The Big Idea is the overarching concept. Based on their context, help them think about what matters most to their students.
        
        NEVER ask for information already provided. Build on their context.
        """
```

### Question Sequencing Strategy

**One Question at a Time:**
```python
# Good prompting
"Based on your [SUBJECT] focus, what big concept do you want students to deeply understand?"

# Bad prompting  
"What's your big idea? What grade level? How long is the project? What resources do you have?"
```

**Follow-Up Logic:**
1. **Acknowledge** what user provided
2. **Build** on their response  
3. **Clarify** one specific aspect
4. **Advance** toward next decision point

### Confusion Detection and Response

**Detection Patterns (from GeminiService.detectConfusion()):**
```typescript
const confusionPatterns = [
  /not sure/, /don't understand/, /confused/,
  /what.*mean/, /unclear/, /explain/
];
```

**Response Strategy:**
1. **Acknowledge:** "That's completely normal!"
2. **Simplify:** Break down the concept
3. **Contextualize:** Use their specific data
4. **Offer Options:** Provide 2-3 clear paths forward

### Example-Based Prompting

**When User Requests Examples:**
```python
# Generate contextual examples, not generic ones
f"""
Here are some Big Ideas that work well for {grade_level} {subject}:

[Generate 3-4 examples using wizard context]

Which direction feels most relevant to your students?
"""
```

---

## 5. DECISION POINTS AND STAGE TRANSITIONS

### Transition Logic Architecture

**Current Implementation (ChatbotFirstInterfaceFixed.tsx):**
```typescript
const detectStageTransition = (userInput: string, aiResponse: string) => {
  // Track message count
  setProjectState(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    messageCountInStage: prev.messageCountInStage + 1
  }));
  
  // Stage-specific transition logic
  if (projectState.stage === 'BIG_IDEA' && userInput.length > 10) {
    if (!input.includes('?') && !input.includes('help')) {
      // User provided concept, not question
      moveToEssentialQuestion(userInput);
    }
  }
};
```

### Decision Point Framework

**For Each Stage:**
1. **Minimum Viable Input:** What's the least info needed to progress?
2. **Quality Indicators:** How do we know the input is sufficient?
3. **Refinement Triggers:** When should we ask for clarification?
4. **Transition Conditions:** When do we move forward?

### Big Idea → Essential Question Transition

**Trigger Conditions:**
```typescript
// Positive indicators
userInput.length > 10 &&
!input.includes('?') &&           // Not asking question
!input.includes('help') &&        // Not seeking help
!input.includes('example')        // Not requesting examples

// Quality checks
const seemsConceptual = !input.includes('activity') && 
                       !input.includes('project') &&
                       !input.includes('students will');
```

**Data Capture:**
```typescript
setProjectState(prev => ({
  ...prev,
  ideation: { 
    ...prev.ideation, 
    bigIdea: userInput, 
    bigIdeaConfirmed: true 
  },
  stage: 'ESSENTIAL_QUESTION',
  messageCountInStage: 0
}));
```

### Essential Question → Challenge Transition

**Trigger Conditions:**
```typescript
// Question indicators
input.includes('?') ||            // Contains question mark
userInput.split(' ').length > 5   // Substantive response

// Quality validation
const isOpenEnded = !input.match(/^(do|does|is|are|can|will)/i);
const isInquiry = input.includes('how') || input.includes('why') || input.includes('what');
```

### Flexible Transition Handling

**User Jumps Ahead:**
```python
# If user provides all elements at once
if detectsMultipleElements(userInput):
    extractAndStore(bigIdea, essentialQuestion, challenge)
    confirmWithUser("I see several great elements here...")
    moveToAppropriateStage()
```

**User Wants to Go Back:**
```typescript
// Allow revisiting previous stages
const allowStageNavigation = (targetStage: string) => {
  if (isValidStage(targetStage) && isAccessible(targetStage)) {
    setProjectState(prev => ({
      ...prev,
      stage: targetStage,
      messageCountInStage: 0
    }));
  }
};
```

### Completion Validation

**Stage Completion Criteria:**
```typescript
interface StageCompletionCriteria {
  BIG_IDEA: {
    required: ['bigIdea'];
    quality: ['isConceptual', 'isGradeAppropriate'];
  };
  ESSENTIAL_QUESTION: {
    required: ['essentialQuestion'];
    quality: ['isOpenEnded', 'connectsToBigIdea'];
  };
  CHALLENGE: {
    required: ['challenge', 'audience'];
    quality: ['isAuthentic', 'isAchievable'];
  };
}
```

---

## 6. DATA EXTRACTION FROM CONVERSATIONS

### Extraction Strategy

**Immediate Capture:**
- Store user input exactly as provided
- Tag with conversation context
- Mark confidence level

**Smart Parsing:**
- Extract multiple elements from single response
- Identify intent vs. content
- Preserve user's voice and language

### Implementation Pattern

```typescript
// From conversation to structured data
interface ConversationExtraction {
  stageData: {
    bigIdea?: string;
    essentialQuestion?: string;
    challenge?: string;
  };
  conversationContext: {
    userConfidence: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
    refinementNeeded: boolean;
    alternativesConsidered: string[];
  };
  qualityIndicators: {
    alignsWithWizardData: boolean;
    meetsStageRequirements: boolean;
    hasRealWorldConnection: boolean;
  };
}
```

### Big Idea Extraction

**From User Input:**
```typescript
const extractBigIdea = (userInput: string) => {
  // Clean the input
  const cleaned = userInput
    .replace(/^(I think|Maybe|How about)/i, '')
    .replace(/students will|they will/gi, 'students')
    .trim();
  
  // Validate it's conceptual
  const isConceptual = !cleaned.match(/(activity|project|assignment|students will do)/i);
  
  return {
    text: cleaned,
    confidence: isConceptual ? 'high' : 'medium',
    needsRefinement: !isConceptual
  };
};
```

### Essential Question Extraction

**Pattern Recognition:**
```typescript
const extractEssentialQuestion = (userInput: string) => {
  // Look for question patterns
  const questionMarkers = /\?|how|why|what|when|where|which/i;
  const hasQuestionFormat = questionMarkers.test(userInput);
  
  // Extract the actual question
  const questionMatch = userInput.match(/([^.!]*\?)/);
  const question = questionMatch ? questionMatch[1] : userInput;
  
  return {
    text: question.trim(),
    isOpenEnded: !question.match(/^(do|does|is|are|can|will)/i),
    connectsToBigIdea: assessConnection(question, currentBigIdea)
  };
};
```

### Challenge Extraction

**Authenticity Assessment:**
```typescript
const extractChallenge = (userInput: string) => {
  // Look for action words and audience indicators
  const actionWords = /(create|design|solve|help|develop|build|investigate)/i;
  const audienceIndicators = /(community|parents|school|local|real)/i;
  
  const hasAction = actionWords.test(userInput);
  const hasAudience = audienceIndicators.test(userInput);
  
  return {
    text: userInput.trim(),
    isAuthentic: hasAction && hasAudience,
    suggestedAudience: extractAudience(userInput),
    needsRefinement: !hasAction || !hasAudience
  };
};
```

### Cross-Stage Validation

**Coherence Checking:**
```typescript
const validateCoherence = (ideationData: IdeationData) => {
  const issues = [];
  
  // Check Big Idea → Essential Question alignment
  if (!doThemesAlign(ideationData.bigIdea, ideationData.essentialQuestion)) {
    issues.push('Essential Question might not fully connect to Big Idea');
  }
  
  // Check Essential Question → Challenge alignment  
  if (!doesChallengeAnswerQuestion(ideationData.essentialQuestion, ideationData.challenge)) {
    issues.push('Challenge might not help students answer Essential Question');
  }
  
  return {
    isCoherent: issues.length === 0,
    issues,
    suggestions: generateAlignmentSuggestions(issues)
  };
};
```

## 7. MOVING USERS FORWARD WITH FLEXIBILITY

### Progressive Momentum Strategy

**Core Principle:** Always have a clear next step while allowing deviation

**Implementation:**
1. **Default Path:** Clear progression through stages
2. **Flexible Routing:** Allow jumping ahead or going back
3. **Recovery Mechanisms:** Multiple ways to get unstuck
4. **Validation Points:** Confirm understanding before moving forward

### Gentle Guidance Techniques

**Positive Reinforcement:**
```python
# Always acknowledge what's working
"That's a great start! I can see you're thinking about..."
"Perfect! That direction will really engage your students..."
"Excellent! That connects beautifully to your [CONTEXT]..."
```

**Forward Movement Prompts:**
```python
# Suggest next logical step
"Now that we have your big idea, what question should drive students' investigation?"
"With that essential question, what authentic challenge could students tackle?"
"That challenge is compelling! Who would benefit most from students' work on this?"
```

### Handling Resistance Points

**Common Resistance Patterns:**
- "I'm not sure this is right"
- "Can we try a different approach?"
- "This seems too complicated"
- "My students won't be able to do this"

**Response Framework:**
1. **Validate Concern:** "I understand that worry..."
2. **Reframe Context:** "Let's think about your [GRADE/SUBJECT] students..."
3. **Offer Alternatives:** "We could approach this differently..."
4. **Simplify if Needed:** "Let's start smaller..."

### Flexibility Mechanisms

#### Stage Navigation

**Allow Movement When:**
```typescript
// User can go back to refine
if (userSays('can we change the big idea?')) {
  return {
    action: 'navigate',
    target: 'BIG_IDEA',
    message: 'Absolutely! Let\'s revisit your big idea...'
  };
}

// User can jump ahead if ready
if (userProvidesMultipleElements()) {
  return {
    action: 'extract_and_advance',
    data: extractAllElements(userInput),
    message: 'Great! I see several elements here...'
  };
}
```

#### Parallel Development

**Allow Iterative Refinement:**
```typescript
// Don't lock stages - allow continued refinement
const allowRefinement = (stage: string, newData: any) => {
  return {
    ...currentData,
    [stage]: {
      ...currentData[stage],
      ...newData,
      lastModified: new Date(),
      version: currentData[stage].version + 1
    }
  };
};
```

### Momentum Maintenance

**Conversation Continuity:**
```typescript
// Always reference previous decisions
const buildContextualPrompt = (stage: string) => {
  const context = [];
  
  if (projectState.ideation.bigIdea) {
    context.push(`Big Idea: "${projectState.ideation.bigIdea}"`);
  }
  
  if (projectState.ideation.essentialQuestion) {
    context.push(`Essential Question: "${projectState.ideation.essentialQuestion}"`);
  }
  
  return `Given your ${context.join(' and ')}, let's focus on...`;
};
```

**Progress Acknowledgment:**
```python
# Celebrate progress at each stage
"Great! We now have your big idea and essential question. You're building a solid foundation for student inquiry."

"Perfect! With your challenge defined, students will have clear, authentic work to tackle."

"Excellent! Your project framework is really taking shape. Students are going to love this!"
```

### Error Recovery Pathways

#### When User Gets Stuck

**Detection:**
- Multiple "I don't know" responses
- Requests for help after explanation
- Circular conversation without progress

**Recovery Options:**
1. **Simplify:** Break down into smaller questions
2. **Examples:** Provide contextual examples
3. **Alternatives:** Offer different approaches
4. **Skip:** Allow temporary skip with return later

#### When User Provides Poor Input

**Gentle Redirection:**
```python
# Don't reject - refine
"That's a good start! How might we make it even more [specific/open-ended/authentic]?"

# Provide better alternative
"I see what you're going for. What if we tried something like..."

# Ask for elaboration
"Tell me more about that. What makes you excited about this direction?"
```

### Completion Flexibility

**Multiple Valid Endpoints:**
- Quick overview for time-constrained users
- Detailed planning for thorough users
- Export options at multiple stages
- Return-later mechanisms

**Quality Thresholds:**
```typescript
interface CompletionLevels {
  minimal: {
    required: ['bigIdea', 'essentialQuestion', 'challenge'];
    quality: 'basic';
  };
  standard: {
    required: ['bigIdea', 'essentialQuestion', 'challenge', 'journey'];
    quality: 'good';
  };
  comprehensive: {
    required: ['bigIdea', 'essentialQuestion', 'challenge', 'journey', 'deliverables'];
    quality: 'excellent';
  };
}
```
