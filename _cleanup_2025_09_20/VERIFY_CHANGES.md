## The Issue: Multiple Dev Servers Running

The problem wasn't that changes weren't implemented - they ARE all there. The issue was **multiple dev servers running** from previous sessions:
- 14+ instances of `npm run dev` were running
- This could cause the browser to connect to an old instance

## Solution Applied:
1. Killed all old vite processes
2. Restarted fresh dev server
3. Now running on http://localhost:5173/

## To Test:
1. **Hard refresh your browser** (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)
2. Clear browser cache if needed
3. Navigate to a new chat session

## What You Should See:
- ✅ Smaller textarea (2 lines)
- ✅ Welcome message about "Big Idea" not "Essential Question"
- ✅ When you type "give me ideas" - 3 suggestion cards appear
- ✅ Input like "Culture shapes cities" is ACCEPTED without asking for clarification
- ✅ After 3 messages at any stage, it accepts your input and moves forward

## If Still Not Working:
The changes ARE in the code. If you don't see them:
1. Check which port you're on (should be 5173)
2. Clear all browser data for localhost
3. Open in incognito/private window
4. Check browser console for errors
